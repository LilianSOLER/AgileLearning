<h1>Sprint - Programming Basics</h1>
	
<p>
  This sprint is about getting you going with the basics of programming.
  If you have programmed before, this sprint will be easy, showing the
  basic constructs and syntax available in Java. You will be going
  through this sprint fast. If it is the case, go help someone who is
  a beginner and discovering programming.
</p>
<p>
  If you are a beginner, this sprint is for you, to help you get started.
  It is a short condensed course on the core constructs used in programming.
  Go through the tasks, understand the concepts and the corresponding
  programming constructs, but do not stop there. You need to practice,
  experiment, ask questions, try stuff out. This is what learning a trade
  is about, both knowlegde and know-how. 
</p>
<p>
  The first tasks are really about showing you the constructs and
  how to use them. The latter tasks are about using these constructs
  to write your own programs. So pay close attention during the first
  tasks, be inquisitive, ask around, and experiment. The idea for you
  is to get confortable with programming during the first tasks, before
  taking on programming on your own. Otherwise, it might
  be a bit too much to take on when you will have to design and code
  your own programs with constructs that you barely know and understand.
