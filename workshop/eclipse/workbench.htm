	<h1>Eclipse Workbench</h1>
	<p>
	  The Eclipse <em>Workbench</em> is the heart of the Human User Interface
	  of the Eclipse platform, it plays an equivalent role for Eclipse to the role
	  that <em>Window Managers</em> play for regular operating systems like
	  Linux or Windows. The Eclipse <em>Workbench</em> is based on three essential
	  concepts:
	</p>
	<ul>
	  <li>Perspectives</li>
	  <li>Views</li>
	  <li>Editors</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
	  A perspective in Eclipse is essentially a task-oriented screen organisation.
	  For instance, Eclipse has a Java perspective that contains all the views
	  and editors that Java developers need to write, edit, or format Java code.
	  For debugging, Eclipse offers a different perspective, called the
	  <em>Debug Perspective</em>, with views that are more specific to the task
	  of debugging, such as a <em>Debug</em> view showing threads and call stacks
	  or a <em>Variables</em> showing the values of local variables and arguments.
	</p>

	<h2>Eclipse Java Perspective</h2>

	<p>
	  Look below at a typical organisation of the Eclipse Java Perspective.
	</p>
	<img src="images/Java-Perspective.png" width="90%" />
	<p>
	  Front and center, you see the editors. The Eclipse Java editor is one
	  of the best Java editor available, with the most accurate syntax highlighting
	  of the Java language. It comes with all the bells and whistles that one
	  expects from a modern editor. It is of course configurable, in the
	  Eclipse <em>preferences</em>.
	</p>
	<p>
	  Notice that you can open multiple editors, with each Java source in a different
	  tab. But also, you can display multiple editors side by side. To do that, just
	  grab a tab with your mouse (on the tab label) and drag it where you want it to be
	  on the screen. In fact, you can do that with any view in Eclipse, a perspective
	  is a grid layout and you can drag around any view to any place on the screen.
	</p>
	<p>
	  For instance, look on the left-hand side, we have several views in tabs.
	  The currently selected tab is the <em>Package Explorer</em>, your Java
	  browser in some sense. It shows the Eclipse
	  <a href="workspace.html"><em>Worbench</em></a> from a Java perspective.
	  You can see the list of your projects in the Workbench. If a project
	  is a Java project, you can see the source folders and in each source
	  folders you can seen the Java packages and then the Java classes.
	  In other words, you see your code.
	</p>
	<img src="images/Package-Explorer-Highlighted.png" width="90%" />
  <p>
    We have certain complementary views to the view <em>"PackageExplorer"</em>
    and the editor views.
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li> The view  <em>"Outline"</em>
      that outline the currently selected class.
    </li>
	  <li>
	    The view <em>"Problems"</em> that lists all the problems in your workspace,
	    that are usually compilation problems and project configuration problems.
    </li>
    <li>
      The view <em>"Console"</em> for the output of your running programs.
    </li>
    <li>
      The view <em>"Search"</em> for the results of your global textual
      searches, to start a search, look for the icon that looks like a handheld camping light.
    </li>
	</ol>
	<p>
	  We have highlighted below a few of these views within the <em>Java Perspective</em>
	  to help you locate them.
	</p>
	<img src="images/Java-Perspective-Highlighted.png" width="90%" />

  <p>
    Note: you can open any view in any perspective.
  </p>
  <p>
    Note: you can drag and reorganize the views within a perspective.
