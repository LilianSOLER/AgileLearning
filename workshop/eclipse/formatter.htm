	<h2>Formatter Setup</h2>

	<p>
	  Eclipse provides a great pretty printing feature. This means
	  that Eclipse can format your code automatically, rather than
	  you having to do manually, which is a pain frankly.
	  Simply hit <b>Ctrl-Shift-F</b> in any Java editor pane within
	  Eclipse and Eclipse will just make your code look nice.
	</p>
	<p>
	  The great thing is that you can entirely contol how Eclipse
	  reformats your code. Go back to the <em>Preferences</em> dialog
	  of Eclipse and find the <em>Formatter</em>:
	</p>

	<p>
	  You can edit the <em>built-in</em> formatter setup, renaming
	  to whatever you like. In the figure above, we renamed it to
	  <em>"OG"</em>. So go ahead, edit your formatter configuration,
	  renaming it to something like your initials. Look below,
	  we change the indentation to use spaces only, with an indentation
	  of 2 spaces, which gives a nice compact view of your sources.
	</p>

	<p>
	  Whatever you choose, you need to make sure you all agree within
	  a working group of developers, otherwise, it will be hell when
	  using git and doing merges. You may not fully understand why
	  or even what is git or merges, but trust us, you will want to
	  have the same Formatter configuration within a group of developers
	  working together on a project. So notice that you can export
	  your configuration and others can then import it to have the same.
	</p>
	<p>
	  Personally, I also dislike when Eclipse reformats the comments
	  in my code. However, it is nice to have Eclipse reformat the JavaDoc
	  comments. But this is only ok if you format your JavaDoc comments
	  as HTML, so that Eclipse knows how to do reformat them correctly.
	  Any way, all this is controllable under the <em>comments</em>
	  tab.
