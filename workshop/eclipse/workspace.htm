	<h1>Eclipse Workspace</h1>
	<p>
	  The Eclipse Platform uses the concept of <em>Workspaces</em>, that is,
	  collections of related projects. Usually, a workspace corresponds to a
	  directory in your file system. In that directory, sub-directories are
	  considered by Eclipse as <em>projects</em>.
	</p>
	<p>
	  When you start Eclipse, you will select a <em>workspace</em> directory.
	  From the Java Perspective, you will look at your workspace through
	  the <em>Package Explorer</em> view, usually on the left-hand side
	  of the Java perspective.
	</p>

	<p>
	  You can see the list of your projects in the Workbench. If a project
	  is a Java project, you can see the source folders and in each source
	  folders you can seen the Java packages and then the Java classes.
	  In other words, you see your code.
	</p>
	<p>
	  Eclipse allows you to switch from one workspace to another, but it is
	  not really efficient as it amounts to restarting Eclipse on the other
	  workspace. But the important point is that Eclipse remembers everything
	  per workspace. It remembers how you setup all the preferences,
	  which perspectives you were looking at, the layout of your perspectives.
	</p>
	<p>
	  Everything you do in Eclipse is local to your workspace. This means
	  that when creating a new workspace, you need to go through your setup
	  again. In particular, installing JREs is something that is local
	  to a workspace. This may seem a burden, but it is necessary for advanced
	  users that are managing and configuring multiples workspaces differently.
	  It is possible to export and import preferences, something we suggest
	  you do. Configure your Java preferences once, export them in a know
	  place, and then import them for any new workspace.
