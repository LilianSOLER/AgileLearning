  A code is something that lives, you give it birth but it needs
  to be nurtured, debugged, evolved, and improved. A good part of
  this is to evaluate the performance of your program and to
  see how you could improve that performance.
  This is one important part of a developer's job.

  <h4>Discussing hash codes</h4>
  
  <p>
    One may question how we compute the hash code. Afterall, using the
    first letter works for dictionaries in the real world, but on limited
    alphabets. Also, as we all know, not all the sections of a dictionary
    have the same size. Some are small, others are larger. Therefore,
    searching for certain words may be longer than the search for other words.
  </p>
  <p>
    In the worst case, all words could go in bucket 0, with the pretty
    stupid method <span class="java-method">hashCode</span> given below:
  </p>
  <pre class="prettyprint lang-java">
  public int hashCode() {
    return 0;
  }
  </pre>
  <p>
    If all word objects go to the same bucket, scanning that bucket
    0 would be as costly as the original solution. But if we spread words evenly
    across buckets, we can hope to divide the cost of looking for a word down
    to the number of known words divided by the number of buckets. As explained
    earlier, if we
    have 1000 words evenly spread over 10 buckets,
    each lookup would scan only one bucket with only 100 words.
    We would gain a factor of 10 in performance. 
  </p>
  <p>
    So the question of an effective hash code comes to play.
    To tell the truth, it is something that is complex in the general
    case. But matematicians have shown that the following
    hash code works well with sequence of integer values, which
    therefore works on sequence of characters:
  </p>
  <pre class="prettyprint lang-java">
  public int hashCode() {
    int h = 0;
    for (int i=0;i &lt; nchars;i++)
      h = h ^ chars[i];
    return h; 
  }
  </pre>
  <p>
    Notice that we do not use a sum of the integer values of each character,
    we use the eXclusive-OR (XOR) operator. Why? Because the XOR operator
    gives a much better distribution of words onto buckets. Just trust us
    here or do your own research on the subject. Now, let's consider a few
    design questions on the code given earlier:
  </p>
  <pre class="prettyprint lang-java">
  Word find(Word word) {
    int index = word.hashCode() % buckets.length;
    return buckets[index].find(word); 
  }
  </pre>
