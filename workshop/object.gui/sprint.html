<p>
  This sprint is about graphical user interfaces for several
	reasons. Of course, knowing about graphical user interfaces
	is quite useful for any developers since so many applications
	have one. But it is also interesting because 
	it is a perfect usecase for advanced techniques
	from object-oriented programming. Finally, it introduces
	a very important programming model called <em>event-oriented
	programming</em>. This is going to be so interesting.

		Ce sprint est sur les interfaces graphiques et cela pour
		différent raisons. Tout d'abord, savoir comment marche
		une interface graphique est utile pour tout développeur
		puisque une majorité d'applications en ont une.
		Mais c'est aussi une programmation qui est parfaitement
		adaptée à l'usage des techniques avancées de la programmation
		orientée-objet. Enfin, les interfaces graphiques
		utilise la programmation orientée-événement, un type
		de programmation qu'il est important de comprendre
		et de maîtriser.

	<b>Reminder:</b> import the Eclipse project "object.gui" into your	workspace.

<!--
<p>
	So you should import the Eclipse project "object.gui" into
	your workspace. You know how to do that by now.
	But it is likely that the project will not compile and
	Eclipse will show you a bunch of red stars. This is
	because we have provided you with some tests to help you
	but we have coded these tests using the JUnit framework,
	the version4. If you want to learn more, you can
	learn about that version of JUnit
	<a href="https://junit.org/junit4/">here</a>, but
	it can wait until we will actually start using
	our JUnit tests.

		Vous devez importer le projet Eclipse "object.gui" dans
		votre espace de travail. Il est probable que le projet
		importé ne compile pas,

<p>
	To fix the compilation errors, you need to update
	the build path of the project. So go there and
	select the tab "Libraries". Then click on "Add Library"
	and select JUnit, <b>version 4</b> (<b>not</b>
	the newer versions).
	Click "Apply and Close"
	and that is it. You do not need to know more
	about JUnit right now, we will come back to it
	in time.

1) object graph: as a population of cooperating individuals.
  an object awaits to be invoked
  when invoked, relies on his network of know objects to do what has been asked
    - Point.translate
    - Vector.translate

  Revisiting objects -> event-oriented programming
    letting go of the algorithmic view.
    an object reacts
  example: the button and button listener
           button driven from a string of letter: EDMMMUL

2) Graphic basics -> with my easy wrapping of Swing.
   canvas, pixels, colors, graphic operations
   mouse & keyboard

  - draw points as mouse moves, when button down
  - clear background or not at each repaint
    easier to draw points, but what happens 
    when "shadowing the window with another window"

  - polyline rather than just points
    with clearing background on repaint.
    -> remembering the points of the polyline.
  - letter 'z' for zap -> clear screen
  - creating rectangle/circle
	   - c -> circle
     - r -> rectangle
    both require two points
    show the shape at each mouse move.  
    skills: 
      automata
      understand repaint while progressing an automata
  - select existing shapes by selecting near "points" of the shape.
    hit 'd' for delete the selected shape.
3) Graphic Components and Layouts
  - layout tree vs inheritance tree (component vs container)
    - warmup with tree
    - warmup with component/container as both tree and class hierarchy
  - repaint requests -> paint events -> graphics in local coordinate
  - Canvas and button, label   
  - layout manager: flow and border, given?
  - mouse/keyboard listeners, dispatching mouse/keyboard events

  worm game but as a central canvas, with a label on top
  buttons on the left and a bottom panel with scores,life points,etc.

  flickering? -> use double-buffering in swing...
