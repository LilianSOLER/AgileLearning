	It is time to discuss the basics of graphical user interfaces.
	As you known, a graphical user interface is about a composition
	of widgets such as buttons, labels, text area with scrollbars, etc.
	So within a window, a tree of widgets is layed out over the pixel
	area of the screen where the window is displayed.
	This task is about learning how this works.
  <xfr>
		Il est temps de discuter des bases des interfaces graphiques.
		Comme vous le savez, une interface graphique est une composition
		d'éléments, appelés <em>widgets</em>, tels que des boutons,
		des labels, ou encore des zones de texte. Ainsi, dans une fenêtre,
		il y a un arbre de widgets qui est disposé graphiquement sur
		la surface de la fenêtre. Cette tâche explique comme cela
		est fait.
  </xfr>
</p>
<p>
	So, a graphical interface is a tree of widgets that are layed out
	within a window, look at the example below. On the left-hand side,
	you see the tree of widgets. On the right-hand side, you see the
	corresponding layout in the window, each widget owning a rectangle
	of pixels.
	<xfr>
		Donc une interface graphique est un arbre d'éléments graphiques
		qui sont disposés au sein d'une fenêtre, voici un exemple:
	</xfr>
</p>
<table style="width:100%">
  <tr>
    <th style="text-align:left;" >
			<img src="widget-tree.png" width="90%" />
		</th>
    <th style="text-align:left;" >
			<img src="widget-layout.png" width="60%" />
		</th>
	</tr>
</table>
<p>
	Notice the corresponding colors, letters, and numbers
	that tell you how the tree of widgets on the left-hand side
	is layed out on the right-hand side. Notice these different
	points:
	<xfr>
		Notez la correspondance entre couleurs, lettres, et chiffres,
		c'est elle qui vous permet de comprendre comment les éléments
		de l'arbre sont disposés dans la fenêtre. Notez les points
		suivants:
	</xfr>
</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		Notice the <b>root	of the tree corresponds to the entire window</b>,
		represented using the lighter yellow color on the right-hand side
		of the figure.
		<xfr>
			Notez que la racine de l'arbre s'étends sur toute la surface
			de la fenêtre.
		</xfr>		
	</li>
	<li>
		Notice that <b>children nodes in the
		tree are always layed out on top of their parent node</b>.
		Look on the right-hand side of the figure and notice
		how darker surfaces are painted above lighter ones.
		Now, notice the corresponding colors in the tree, with
		children having a darker color than their parent.
		<xfr>
			Notez que les noeuds enfants sont toujours disposés au dessus
			de la surface de leur noeud parent.
		</xfr>
	</li>
	<li>
		Also notice that <b>children nodes are layout within the bounds
			of their parent node</b>. For instance, notice that the nodes
		4 and 5 are layed out within the bounds of their parent, the node
		c, itself layed out within the bounds of its parent, the root node.
		<xfr>
			Notez aussi que les surfaces attribuées aux noeuds enfants sont
			incluses dans la surface attribuée à leur parent.
		</xfr>
	</li>
</ul>
<p>
	To represent the tree and its graphical layout on the screen,
	we will use the two following classes:
	<xfr>
		Pour représenter l'arbre des éléments, nous allons utiliser
		ces deux classes:
	</xfr>
</p>
<pre class="prettyprint lang-java">
public class Component{
  Container parent;
  int x, y ;               // top-left corner location within the parent
  int width, height ;      // dimension within the parent
}
public class Container extends Component {
  Component children[];    // children of this container
}
</pre>
<p>
	A leaf in the tree is represented by an instance of the
	class <span class="java-class">Component</span> while a
	node in the tree is represented by an instance of the
	class <span class="java-class">Container</span>.
	Do not confuse the layout tree and the inheritance tree.
	The layout tree is an object graph representing how
	components are layed out on the screen. The inheritance tree
	is the fact that the class <span class="java-class">Container</span>
	inherits from the
	class <span class="java-class">Component</span>.
	<xfr>
		Une feuille de l'arbre est représentée par une instance
		de la classe
		<span class="java-class">Component</span> alors
		qu'un noeud de l'arbre est représenté par une instance
		de la classe
		<span class="java-class">Container</span>.
		Ne confondez pas l'arbre qui est un graphe d'objets
		représentant l'organisation des éléments graphiques
		et l'arbre des classes avec la classe
		<span class="java-class">Container</span>
		qui hérite de la classe
		<span class="java-class">Component</span>.
	</xfr>

<h3>Widget Layout</h3>

<p>
	A widget is an element of a user interface, such as a button,
	a lable, or a text area. Widgets are organized as a tree that is
	layed out within a window, here is an example:
</p>
<table style="width:100%">
  <tr>
    <th style="text-align:left;" >
			<img src="widget-tree.png" width="90%" />
		</th>
    <th style="text-align:left;" >
			<img src="widget-layout.png" width="60%" />
		</th>
	</tr>
</table>
<p>
	Notice the corresponding colors, letters, and numbers
	that tell you how the tree of widgets on the left-hand side
	is layed out on the right-hand side. Notice these different
	points:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		Notice the root	of the tree corresponds to the entire window
		(light yellow	color).
	</li>
	<li>
		Notice that children nodes in the
		tree are always layed out on top of their parent node.</li>
	<li>
		Also notice that children nodes are layout within the surface
		of their parent node.
	</li>
</ul>
<p>
	To represent the tree, we will use the two following classes:
</p>
<pre class="prettyprint lang-java">
public class Component{
  Composite parent;
  int x, y ;
  int width, height ;
}
public class Container extends Component {
  Component children[];
  LayoutManager layoutManager;
}
</pre>
<p>
	So a parent container does layout its children components. In fact,
	the layout is delegated to a layout manager
	(class <span class="java-class">LayoutManager</span>).
	In the
	example above, the container 'a' uses a vertical flow layout,
	laying out its children in a vertical sequence. The container 'b'
	uses also a flow layout, but an horizontal one.
</p>
<img src="flow-layout.png" width="100%">
<p>
	The root container uses a border layout of its children components
	(container 'a', 'b', and 'c'), with the 'c' at the center, the 'b'
	up north, and 'a' on the west.
</p>
<img src="border-layout.png" width="100%">

<h3>Coding -- Step One</h3>

<p>
	We will ignore the layout managers for now, we first need to code
	the tree, that is, the classes
	<span class="java-class">Component</span> and
	<span class="java-class">Container</span>.
	The class <span class="java-class">WindowTest</span>
	creates and layout a simple window for you, it should
	look like this:
</p>
<img src="warmup-window.png">
<p>
	You can see the window on the usual Ubuntu purple background.
	Then you see surfaces of different colors, each surface corresponding
	to a different component. You can recognize a border-style layout.
	The center component is dark gray. The north is green and the south
	is red. The east is magenta and the west is blue. Notice that
	you see gaps in light gray, so you actually see the background
	of the parent container showing in between the layout components
	(north, south, east, west, and center). Also notice that you see
	a yellow border, in fact, you are seeing the background color
	of the root component.
</p>

<h3>Coding -- Step Two</h3>

<p>
	We will consider the selection of a component at given coordinates.
	This will be really important in knowing where to route mouse
	and keyboard events. Without components, any keyboard event
	or mouse event is simply delivered to the window. This is what
	we had earlier.
</p>
<p>
	But now, your window contains a layout of components. This means
	that you will need to route mouse and keyboard events to a
	component. But which one?
</p>
<p>
	So let's discuss the mouse first. It seems logical to route
	mouse events to the component that is under the mouse, right?
	For instance, if you click on something inside a component,
	it seems logical that the component receives the mouse button
	events to determine what was clicked.
</p>
<p>
	To do so, we therefore need a way to know which component is
	<em>under</em> the mouse. This means the component that is on
	top and that contains the location of the mouse. This is the
	purpose of the method
	<span class="java-class">Component</span> 
	<span class="java-method">select(int x, int y)</span>
	on the class <span class="java-class">Component</span>.
</p>
<p>
	So go ahead, code that method. When executing the
	class <span class="java-class">WindowTest</span>,
	you see a layout of components. It was layed out
	in such a way that there are gaps in between components.
	This means as you move the mouse around and select the
	component under the mouse, you should be able to select
	any of the component in the layout tree. Neat, right?
</p>
<p>
	So add a mouse listener on the window and whenever the
	mouse moves, selection the component under the mouse
	coordinates and print which component it is. Why printing?
	Because, as you will rapidly discover, debugging a graphical
	application is not that easy. So printing statements for
	debugging becomes unfortunately fashionable again.
</p>
<p>
	So we suggest that you add a name to the class
	<span class="java-class">Component</span> and a method
	<span class="java-method">toString</span> that prints
	the name as well as the bounds of the component, probably
	in global coordinates.
</p>
<p>
	To help you further, we wrote some
	tests for you. If you pass the tests, you are likely to have
	a working tree and a working selection.
	We wrote the tests as JUnit tests, a test framework that is
	nicely integrated within Eclipse.
	We coded these tests using the JUnit framework,
	the <a href="https://junit.org/junit4/">version 4</a>.
	Have a look
	at <a href="http://help.eclipse.org/mars/index.jsp?topic=%2Forg.eclipse.jdt.doc.user%2FgettingStarted%2Fqs-junit.htm">Eclipse JUnit Gest Started Guide</a>.
	Then look at the code of our tests, in the Java package
	<span class="java-package">object.gui.task3.tests</span>,
	the classes 
	<span class="java-class">AllTests</span>, 
	<span class="java-class">TestsA</span>, 
	<span class="java-class">TestsB</span>, and 
	<span class="java-class">TestsC</span>. 
	you will see that writing JUnit tests is really simple
	and almost self-explanatory.
</p>
<p>
	To launch the tests under Eclipse, nothing easier,
	just right-click on the package
	<span class="java-package">object.gui.task3.tests</span>
	and select <em>"Run As JUnit Test"</em> or
	<em>"Debug As JUnit Test"</em>. Then you will see
	a new JUnit pane, in the Eclipse interface, showing
	you all the tests, if they passed (green) or if they
	failed (red). For those that failed, you also have
	the reason. Then, execute the failed test under
	debugger to understand and fix the problem.
