  Putting into practice what you have learned is crucial.
  It is the difference between a regular course and a workshop.
  It is the difference between learning and knowing how to do.
  We are learning a trade and that requires practice, a lot
  of it.

Explain how it will work.

Ask them to do something.
- need to be rigorous, in terms of names and signatures.
package name, class name, method name.
explain what is the signature...
explain why it is important: caller/callee "contract"
-> will be checked, so they know if they got it right.

- code the methods
expected to compile -> ant  
expected to execute -> writing their own tests.

- pass our tests, expected to be more thorough...
-> ant tests
if a test fails, expected to debug it.

- all checks and tests will be passed server-side,
once the work has been git-pushed.
will drive the dashboard.

- all checks and tests must pass, to unlock the next task.


<h4>Project Setup</h4>

<p>
  Locate the project <em>first.codes</em>.
  Create the src/bin structure.
  Create a package "ricm3.util".
</p>

<p>
  Ask them to document the behavior of the methods,
  the valid values for parameters,
  in particular the error conditions and the exceptions thrown.
</p>

First Math
abs(int) abs(float)
-> introduce them to return values
-> introduce them to int versus float
-> the ability to have same name, but different signature
-> use if-then construct

min/max with (int,int) or (float,float)
-> any number of parameters are possible
-> use if-then-else construct

compare(int,int) or (float,float)
-> return -1,0,+1 depending < == >

  fact(int) and only int, not defined on float.
