  What do we know about the class <span class="java-class">Peg</span>.
  Looking at the Wikipedia description, we know that:	  
</p>
<ul>
  <li> Each peg represents a stack of disks. </li>
  <li> We know the maximum number of disks a peg can have. </li>
</ul>
<p>
  So this looks like we know enough to design the class
  <span class="java-class">Peg</span>, we gave a skeleton
  version of it in the package
  <span class="java-package">hanoi.tower</span>.
  Let's complete it together.
</p>

<h4>Fields and Constructor</h4>

<p>
  So you have to decide which fields you want and
  you also have to implement the following constructor,
  with the given argument being the maximum number of
  disks a peg can stack up.
  Remember to protect as private what needs to be
  and declare public the rest.

   classname="hanoi.tower.TestPeg">

  <hint>
    Not quite, fix your code please.
    The class <span class="java-class">Peg</span> should be public,
    with the necessary public constructor, taking the maximum size as an
    argument (typed as an <span class="java-keyword">int</span>).
    Also, declare all fields as private.

    Everything looks fine.

<h4> Adding push and pop methods </h4>

<p>
  Looking at Wikipedia again, we can see that a peg must
  ensure some invariants:
</p>
<ul>
  <li> A disk is on at most one peg at any one time. </li>
  <li> A disk can only be added the top of a peg. </li>
  <li> Only the top disk of a peg can be removed. </li>
</ul>
<p>
  These invariants are the typical invariants of a stack.
  You need to implement the two following methods:
</p>
<pre class="prettyprint lang-java">
  class Peg {
    public void push(Disk d) { ... }
    public Disk pop(Disk d) { ... }
  }
</pre>
<p>
  The semantics of the methods are quite straightforward.
  The method <span class="java-method">push</span> stacks
  a disk on top of the peg.
  The method <span class="java-method">pop</span> removes
  the top disk from the peg.
  But there are interesting questions:
  <xfr>
    La sémantique des méthodes est assez évidente.
    La méthodes <span class="java-method">push</span> empile un disque
    au sommet d'un pilier.
    La méthode <span class="java-method">pop</span> enlève le disque
    du dessus d'un pilier.
    Il y a deux questions intéressantes:
  </xfr>
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    What should happen if the method
    <span class="java-method">pop</span> is invoked on a
    peg with no disk?
  </li>
  <li>
    What should happen if the method
    <span class="java-method">push</span> is invoked on a
    peg that is full?
    </li>
  <li>
    What should happen if the method
    <span class="java-method">push</span> is invoked
    with a disk not smaller than the one on the top?
  </li>
  <li>
    What should happen if a disk is pushed on
    more than one peg? And how would you know about that? 
  </li>
</ol>
<p>
  These questions are important to ask. You can decide
  that you assume that a peg is handled properly and
  that these situations never occur. Or you may prefer
  to be safe than sorry. We will choose to be safe here,
  you will make sure these special cases are detected
  throw an exception. You can throw an IllegalStateException
  or you can use asserts.

    This check will accept that your code either throws
    IllegalStateExceptions or experiences failed asserts.

<h3> Adding some more methods </h3>

<p>
  Before we can complete the Hanoi Tower puzzle, we will need
  to add some more methods on the class <span class="java-class">Peg</span>.
</p>
<pre class="prettyprint lang-java">
  class Peg {
    public int size() { ... }
    public Disk peekAt(int depth) { ... }
    public boolean legalMove(Peg dst) { ... }
  }
</pre>
<ul>
  <li>
		<em>int size()</em>: this one is obvious, return the number of disks
    stacked on the peg.
  </li>
  <li>
		<em>Disk peekAt(int)</em>: returns the disk on the peg, at the given depth.
		Depth zero is the bottom, the lowest disk underneath all the others.
		<b>Warning:</b> peeking is not popping, disks are not removed,
		it is just about knowing which disk is at a given depth. 
  </li>
  <li>
			<em>Disk legalMove(Peg)</em>: returns true if the top disk of the source peg
			can be moved to the given destination peg.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
  So the one method that may be a bit challenging is the method
  <span class="java-method">legalMove</span>. There are several points to
  consider:
</p>
<ol>
  <li> Returns false if the source peg is empty. </li>
  <li> It is always possible to move a disk to an empty peg. </li>
  <li> The top disk at the destination peg must be larger than the moving disk. </li>
</ol>

    Disk dtop = dst.disks[dst.ndisks - 1];
    return (top.size() &lt; dtop.size());
  }
  </pre>
