  So let's talk about types, in details.
  You know what is a type, you use it every day when coding. You use types
  to <em>"type"</em> your variables, such as "int" or "char". You use
  types to type your arrays, like "int[]". So what is a type?
</p>
<p>
  A type describes what kind
  of values can be stored somewhere, in the element of an array, in a variable,
  or in the field of an object. A type also dictates what operations are legal
  on such values.
</p>
<p>
  Types in our language fulfill the same goal. Our types also describe
  what kind of values can be stored in variables and elements of arrays.
  Just like that:
</p>
<pre class="prettyprint lang-java">
  int x = 2;
  int[] array = new int[3];
  array[0] = x + 3;
</pre>
<p>
  Types are also used to type expressions. Indeed,
  to assign "array[0]" with the value from the expression "x + 2",
  you must make sure that the expression is typed as an integer.
  This is the case in the code snippet above. In contrast,
  you could not write something like this:
</p>
<pre class="prettyprint lang-java">
  float x = 2.5;
  int[] array = new int[3];
  array[0] = x + 3.1;
</pre>
<p>
  Why? Because the expression evaluates to "5.6", which is a float
  value and the array only contains integer values. This last statement
  should be rejected because it would entail a loss of
  information, since the value "5.6" would have to be rounded
  <em>implicitely</em> to the integer value "5". 
  Of course, you can force <em>explicitly</em>
  the conversion yourself:
</p>
<pre class="prettyprint lang-java">
  float x = 2.5;
  int[] array = new int[3];
  array[0] = (int)(x + 3.1);
</pre>
<p>
  The explicit cast operation expresses that you
  know what you are doing and rounding the value "5.6"
  into the integer value "5" is what you want. 
</p>
<p>
  See types are used all the time, both by you and the
  interpreter. You use types to express what you
  want. The interpreter uses types to interpret what you typed.
  So the type system in place is central to the dialog between you
  and the interpreter, so the type system must be discussed
  explicitly. Something that we did already when introducing
  our language in this <a href="t2.html">task</a>.
</p>

<h3>Implementing a type system</h3>

<p>
  The discussion
  here is the design of classes necessary for the interpreter to
  represent our type system.
  This all starts with two classes, the class 
  <span class="java-class">Type</span> and the class
  <span class="java-class">TypeSystem</span>.
</p>
<p>
  The class
  <span class="java-class">Type</span> is used
  to represent all the known types:
</p>  
<ul>
  <li>Primitive types:
    <span class="java-keyword">boolean</span>,
    <span class="java-keyword">char</span>,
    <span class="java-keyword">int</span>,
    <span class="java-keyword">float</span>
  </li>
  <li>
    Special types:
    <span class="java-keyword">void</span>,
    <span class="java-keyword">any</span>
  </li>
  <li>
    Array types such as 
    <span class="java-keyword">int[]</span> or
    <span class="java-keyword">char[]</span>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  So how do we represent a type? Well, using a class,
  since a type is an entity manipulated by our
  interpreter. So what are the fields and methods
  of that class?
</p>
<pre class="prettyprint lang-java">
public abstract class Type {

  private String m_name;

  protected Type(String name) {
    m_name = name;
    TypeSystem.add(this);
  }

  public abstract Value cast(Value v);
  public abstract Value zero();
</pre>
<p>
  Look at the constructor first, it tells us
  that a type has a name (we voluntarily
  ignore that a type may also have a number).
  The name is the name
  you use in the source code, such as
  <span class="java-keyword">char</span> or
  <span class="java-keyword">int</span>.
  It is important to therefore understand
  that there will be one instance of the
  class <span class="java-class">Type</span>
  per known type.
  Look at the class
  <span class="java-class">TypeSystem</span>,
  you will see it is an index for all
  known types.
</p>
<pre class="prettyprint lang-java">
public class TypeSystem {
  private static HashTable types = new HashTable();

  public static void add(Type type) {
    types.put(type.name(),type);
  }

  public static Type lookup(String name) {
    return (Type) types.get(name);
  }
}
</pre>
<p>
  Any type created is added to the hash table
  of types, indexed by name, so that types
  can be looked up by names when encountered
  during the parsing of statements.
  This indexing is done by the constructor
  of the class
  <span class="java-class">Type</span>.
</p>
<p>
  A type describes the values of that type,
  but it can also be used to cast values.
  This is the purpose of the method
  <span class="java-method">cast</span>.
  This method is used by the interpreter
  when it needs to transform a value of one
  type to a value of another type.
  For example, when you typed this:
</p>
<pre class="prettyprint lang-java">
  int x = (int)(2.3+5.6);
</pre>
<p>
  The addition produces a float value that
  is then casted to an integer value. It is
  the method
  <span class="java-method">cast</span> that
  does the transform. But which casts
  are legal and which ones are not?

<p>
  How do we read this matrix?
  It tells you if a type (as a row) can be casted to
  another type (as a column). For instance, the
  type <span class="java-keyword">float</span> can
  be casted to an
  <span class="java-keyword">int</span>,
  to a
  <span class="java-keyword">float</span>,
  and to a
  <span class="java-keyword">any</span>.
</p>
<p>
  The types
  <span class="java-keyword">void</span> and
  <span class="java-keyword">any</span> are
  special types. 
  The type
  <span class="java-keyword">void</span>
  is a type that never has a value, since
  it is used to type functions that do not
  return a value.
  So casting is a non-issue for the type
  <span class="java-keyword">void</span>.
  The type
  <span class="java-keyword">any</span>
  is a bit harder to understand.
</p>
<p>
  The type
  <span class="java-keyword">any</span>,
  is a polymorphic abstract type that allows
  to define polymorphic variables and
  polymorphic arrays. For example, look
  at the snippets below:
</p>

<pre class="prettyprint lang-java">
  any x = 2;
  any[] array = new any[4];
  array[0] = 2;
  array[1] = 2.4;
  array[2] = 'c';
  array[3] = true;
</pre>
<p>
  See, the use is a bit similar to the use of
  the class
  <span class="java-class">Object</span> in Java
  where you could write this:
</p>  

<pre class="prettyprint lang-java">
  Object[] array = new Object[4];
  array[0] = new String("toto");
  array[1] = new Foo();
  array[2] = new Bar();
</pre>
<p>
  The type <span class="java-keyword">any</span>
  is abstract in the sense that there is no
  value of the type <span class="java-keyword">any</span>,
  except the value <em>"zero"</em> used to initialize
  variables and array elements.
  Look at the class <span class="java-class">AnyValue</span>.
  You can verify that we have a single instance of the
  class <span class="java-class">AnyValue</span>.
</p>
<pre class="prettyprint lang-java">
public class AnyValue extends Value {

  public static AnyValue zero;

  public AnyValue() {
    super(AnyType.TYPE());
    if (zero != null)
      throw new IllegalStateException("AnyValue is a singleton");
    zero = this;
  }
}
</pre>
<p>
  Now look at the class 
  <span class="java-class">AnyType</span>,
  you will be able to see that the type 
  <span class="java-keyword">any</span> is
  therefore only a way to view values of other types,
  rather than defining values of its own.
  This is what an abstract type is. It does not
  define a value, it allows to view a value a certain way
  and it allows to manipulate that value certains ways.
  An abstract
  type is all about what you can do to a value, rather
  than about what is the format of a value.
  How do you see that? Well, look at the method
  <span class="java-method">cast</span>:
</p>

<pre class="prettyprint lang-java">
public class AnyType extends Type {

  @Override
  public Value cast(Value v) {
    return v;
  }
</pre>
<p>  
  See, casting is always allowed and does nothing
  to the value. So
  the type <span class="java-keyword">any</span>
  is only a view on a value, not a format of
  a value. A value is never transformed into
  an <span class="java-keyword">any</span> value,
  but it can always be seen as a value
  of type <span class="java-keyword">any</span>.
  So what is the use of all this?
</p>
<p>
  Abstract types allow to write generic code, code that
  applies to many types. For example, we can write a generic
  method that copies arrays:
</p>
<pre class="prettyprint lang-java">
void array_copy(any[] dst, any[] src) {
  int i;
  int len;
  i = 0;
  len = length(dst);
  while (i &lt; len) {
    dst[i]=src[i];
    i=i+1;
  }
}
</pre>
<p>
  Without the type
  <span class="java-keyword">any</span>, we would have
  to write a copy method for every single type of
  arrays, such as
  <span class="java-keyword">int[]</span>,
  <span class="java-keyword">char[]</span>,
  <span class="java-keyword">float[]</span>, and so on.
  With the type
  <span class="java-keyword">any</span>, we can
  write a single method that works for arrays of
  all types.
</p>
<p>
  This is really cool and we hope it helps you understand
  polymorphic programming in Java. Using interfaces is a
  way to write generic code, it works on any object that implements
  that interface. But object-oriented programming is polymorphic
  at heart since any code is written to manipulate objects,
  instances of certain classes, but in reality, these objects
  may be instances of any subclass. Polymorphic programming
  is your key for opening the door to a new world of
  software development.
</p>

<h3>Finishing the implementation</h3>

<p>
  We gave you the complete class hiearchy for types,
  but the implementation is incomplete and must be fixed.
  Look at the class <span class="java-class">Type</span>,
  see the method
  <span class="java-method">cast</span> and
  how it needs fixing:
</p>

<pre class="prettyprint lang-java">
public abstract class Type {
  public Value cast(Value v) {
    return v; // TODO: fix me.
  }
}
</pre>
<p>
  This is obviously wrong since not all types can cast
  all values. So turn this method into an abstract method
  and override it in all subclasses.
  To help you get started, we gave you an implementation
  for the class 
  <span class="java-class">FloatType</span>.
  We also gave you a fully implemented class
  <span class="java-class">AnyType</span>.
  So go have
  a look, read and understand the code, then override
  the same three methods for all the other types.
</p>
