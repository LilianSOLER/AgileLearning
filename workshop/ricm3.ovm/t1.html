  The goal of this task is to get you started with the concept of a
  parser that builds an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) that is then evaluated
  by an interpreter. You are already familiar with the concepts:
  parser, builder, and interpreter. They were present in the previous
  calculator code we wrote. Here, we will more precisely understand
  what these concepts are:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>Parser</li>
  <li>Abstract Syntax Tree</li>
  <li>Interpreter</li>
</ol>
<p>
  The parser parses some text, a sequence of characters that represents
  a program. From parsing that text, the parser builds
  an Abstrat Syntax Tree (AST); the AST is the tree of objects representing
  the program. Understand that the source of a program is a textual form,
  it is a sequence of characters. That sequence of characters can be parsed
  and a tree of objects can be created whose purpose is to represent the
  same program, but using objects rather than characters.
</p>
<p>
  The purpose of the AST is to be evaluated. Why? To interpret the program.
  See, the interpreter is a program that will interpret the program represented
  by an AST in order to execute it. Our language here will be simple, it will
  be about evaluating arithmetic expressions and managing a few variables.
  So the interpretation of ASTs will be about evaluated arithmetic expressions
  and assigning variables with values. Nothing too difficult to understand.
</p>
<p>
  When we coded our calculator, we saw pretty much the same concepts.
  We saw such a tree when coding our calculator, remember?
  We created a tree of objects that represented an expression.
  Then, we evaluated that tree to compute the value of an expression.
  Here, the idea is the same, but applied to a different language,
  introducing variables. Also, the code structure is a bit different,
  introducing a parser, a builder, and an intepreter.
</p>

<h3>The language</h3>

<p>
  We need to start with the syntax and semantics of the language
  we intend to parse and represent as objects. Indeed, we need
  to know what we are talking about.
</p>
<p>
  The syntax of a language is what you have the right to write down.
  Like for french or english, the language is composed of words,
  and each word has a specific spelling. Then, words can be composed
  in statements that means something. So for instance, you can write:
</p>
<pre>
  2 + 3
  2 + (3 * 4)
</pre>
<p>
  You cannot write the following:
</p>
<pre>
  2 #$ ^%^#@@
  @x : 2 * 3
</pre>
<p>
  So what can you write? You can write arithmetic expressions,
  using integer values, the classical arithmetic operators ('+', '-',
  '*', '/'). You may also use parenthesis.
  The following statements are examples of
  arithmetic expressions:
</p>
<pre>
  (2 + 3) - 3
  2 + (3 * 4) / 2
</pre>
<p>
  You can also write statements that are assignments:
</p>
<pre>
  x = 2
  y = 3 * x
</pre>
<p>
  Notice that a statement names a variable on
  the left-hand side of the '=' sign and gives an expression
  on the right-hand side. The semantics is the following.
  First, the named variable must be looked up in the context
  and created if it does not already exist. What is the context?
  The context is the list of all known variables. What is
  a variable? It is a name and a current value.
  Second, the named variable must be assigned with the value
  resulting from the evaluation of the expression.
</p>
<p>
  An interpreter is a never-ending loop. It gets a line of text
  as input, it parses it, and then interprets it. The interpretation
  is about executing what the text means, exactly like your brain
  does when reading some text. You first parse the text to recognize
  the words and then you interpret the words to get the meaning
  of the text. So for instance,
  you can understand the following text:
<p>
<pre>
  x = 2 + 3
  y = 4 * x
</pre>
<p>
  Because you know the semantics of a number (it is that number
  itself) and you know the semantics of the '+' and '*' operators,
  they represent the addition and the multiplication.
  You also know the semantics of the assignment operator '='.
  Having this knowledge, your brain can interpret that text and know that
  in the end the value of the variable 'x' is '5' and the value
  of the variable 'y' is '20'.
</p>
<p>
  Here, we are trying to write a program that can do the same.
  The program will parse and interpret
  the same text, like your brain does. The parser will parse the
  text and produce a tree of objects that describe the meaning
  of the text. Then, it will be able to evaluate that tree of
  objects, which will in fact interpret the meaning of the original
  text. The result of this evaluation will be that the
  the value of the variable 'x' will be '5' and the value
  of the variable 'y' will be '20'.
</p>

<h3>The Parser/Builder/Interpreter Combo</h3>

<p>
  Now, we will introduce the parser and the builder for the AST.
  The parser is the code that reads a stream of characters, the
  source of the program, and drives the builder in order to
  build the AST. Look at the interface
  <span class="java-class">IBuider</span>:
</p>
<pre class="prettyprint lang-java">
public interface IBuilder {
  Expression newValue(String s);
  Expression newNegOp(Expression e);
  Expression newAddOp(Expression e1,Expression e2);
  Expression newSubOp(Expression e1,Expression e2);
  Expression newDivOp(Expression e1,Expression e2);
  Expression newMultOp(Expression e1,Expression e2);
  Symbol newSymbol(String name);
  Assignment newAssignment(String name, Expression exp);
}
</pre>
<p>
  You can guess what this interface is about, don't you?
  It is a factory to create nodes in the AST.
  Whenever the parser encounters a concept in the
  character stream of the source, it invokes the builder
  to create a corresponding node.
  So for example, let's assume that you type this source:
</p>
<pre>
  2 + 3 * 4
</pre>
<p>
  A parser given that input stream could invoke the following
  sequence on the builder:
</p>
<pre class="prettyprint lang-java">
  Expression v1 = builder.newValue("2");
  Expression v2 = builder.newValue("3");
  Expression v3 = builder.newValue("4");
  Expression e1 = builder.newMultOp(v2,v3);
  Expression e2 = builder.newAddOp(v1,e2);
</pre>
<p>
  This would correspond to the interpretation
  of the expression as:
</p>
<pre>
  2 + (3 * 4)
</pre>
<p>
  Another parser might understand the stream of characters
  differently such as:
</p>
<pre>
  (2 + 3) * 4
</pre>
<p>
  In that case, the sequence of invocations on the builder will
  be different:
</p>
<pre class="prettyprint lang-java">
  Expression v1 = builder.newValue("2");
  Expression v2 = builder.newValue("3");
  Expression e1 = builder.newAddOp(v1,v2);
  Expression v3 = builder.newValue("4");
  Expression e2 = builder.newMultOp(e1,v3);
</pre>
<p>
  Now let's assume that we also have an assignement.
</p>
<pre>
  x = (2 + 3) * 4
</pre>
<p>
  The parser would invoke the builder like this:
</p>
<pre class="prettyprint lang-java">
  Expression v1 = builder.newValue("2");
  Expression v2 = builder.newValue("3");
  Expression e1 = builder.newAddOp(v1,v2);
  Expression v3 = builder.newValue("4");
  Expression e2 = builder.newMultOp(e1,v3);
  Assignment a = builder.newAssignment("x",e2);
</pre>
<p>
  Which will create the following AST:
</p>
<img src="images/expression-tree.svg" />

<p>
  So for instance, the evaluation of this AST
  above would create
  the variable 'x' and would assign that
  variable with the value '20' resulting from
  the evaluation of the expression "(2+3)*4".
  So the variable 'x' would now be part
  of the context of the interpreter.
  You could write something like this:
</p>
<pre>
  y = (3 * x) / 2
</pre>
<p>
  Which will create the following AST:
</p>
<img src="images/expression2-tree.svg" />
<p>
  Notice the symbol "x" appearing in the expression.
  A symbol is the name of a variable. Its presence
  in an expression means that the name will be used
  to look up a variable in the context of the interpreter.
  If a variable with that name is found, its value
  will be used. In the case above, the variable "x"
  exists and its value is '20'. So the variable "y"
  will be created and assigned with the value '30'.
</p>

<h4>Finishing the implementation</h4>

<p>
  We gave you a fully functional parser, 
  in the <em>"parser.jar"</em>. We gave you the
  sources, but we suggest that you do not look at them.
  This is generated code and it is mostly unreadable.
  However, having it may help you in some debugging situation,
  so we gave it to you.
</p>
<p>
  The parser is functional and will create an instance
  of the class <span class="java-class">Builder</span>,
  a class that implements the interface
  <span class="java-class">IBuilder</span>.
  That class is incomplete, we ask that you finish the
  implementation.
</p>
<p>
  We also gave you working interpreter, look at the class
  <span class="java-class">Interpreter</span>,
  you will see the never-ending loop of an
  interpreter: parsing and evaluating.
  However, we did not implement the context, we
  just created the skeleton in the class
  <span class="java-class">Context</span>.
  So go ahead finish the implementation of the
  class <span class="java-class">Context</span>.
</p>
<p>
  To launch the execution, you can launch 
  the class 
  <span class="java-class">OvmTask1</span>
  in the package
  <span class="java-package">rim3.ovm</span>.
</p>
<p>
  This is really easy coding. Remember, the goal is that
  you understand the relationship between a parser, a builder,
  and an interpreter. The parser is given to you, you did not write
  that code. The builder is written by you and obeys the
  invocations of the parser. The builder builds an AST that
  the interpreter will evaluate in
  order to interpret the meaning of the text.
  Finally, the interpreter uses your context to manage
  the known variables.
