<p>
  As we said earlier, you use types every day when coding, but why?
  Some programming languages do not use typed variables, such as
  JavaScript. A variable may hold any value, at any time. So why
  use types in some programming languages and not in others?
  The main difference is how soon a misunderstanding is detected?
</p>
<p>
  Remember, types are helping you express what you want and they
  are also helping the interpreter understand what you want. Sometimes,
  what you express is not correct and types will help figure that
  you made a mistake. Right? As we discussed earlier, you can write:
</p>
<pre class="prettyprint lang-java">
  int x = 2;
  int[] array = new int[3];
  array[0] = x + 3;
</pre>
<p>
  But you cannot write:
</p>
<pre class="prettyprint lang-java">
  float x = 2.5;
  int[] array = new int[3];
  array[0] = x + 3.1;
</pre>
<p>
  Now, the type system will catch the mistake, the question is how
  soon in the development process. With untyped programming languages,
  the mistake will be discovered when executing statements. With typed
  programming languages, the mistake will be when compiling the source.
  See, this is why the Java compiler is so good at given you so many
  red crosses in Eclipse, indicating mistakes as you are writing the
  code in the editor. In JavaScript, you would have to finish the code
  and then run it in order to discover that you made a mistake.
  We are not saying one is better than the other, we are just pointing
  a difference.
</p>
<p>
  With our interpreter, we decided to adopt types, pretty much like
  TypeScript, a typed version of JavaScript. The idea is therefore
  to discover type-related mistakes during the parsing of the source.
  In our case, this is quite important since we do not have a debugger
  for our language yet. Therefore, discovering type-related bugs at
  parse time would help developers using our language.
</p>
<p>
  So types will be used by the parser in order to discover mistakes as
  early as possible, before any statement is interpreted by the interpreter.
  This means we want the do the following:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>All expressions will be typed as they are parsed.</li>
  <li>Assignments, when parsed, will check type compatibility.</li>
</ol>
<p>
  This mainly impacts the following classes:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>Class <span class="java-class">Statement</span></li>
  <li>Class <span class="java-class">Expression</span></li>
  <li>Class <span class="java-class">Assignment</span></li>
  <li>Class <span class="java-class">Symbol</span></li>
</ol>
<p>
  This classes are all part of the implementation
  of the Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) and used by the parser
  to build a tree when parsing a statement:
</p>
<pre class="prettyprint lang-java">
  > 2 + 3 ;
  -> 5
  > x = 2 + 3 ;
  >
</pre>
<p>
  A statement can be an expression, like "2+3".
  A statement can also be an assignment, like "x = 2+3".
  As you can see, an assignment involves a symbol on the left-hand
  side and an expression on the right-hand side.
</p>
<p>
  A symbol is naming a variable and in fact can be used on
  the left-hand side of an assignment, but it can also be used
  anywhere in an expression:
</p>
<pre class="prettyprint lang-java">
  > x = 2 + y ;
</pre>
<p>
  When on the left-hand
  side, the named variable is written with the value resulting
  from the expression on the right-hand side. When used on
  the right-hand side, the value of the name variable is read
  to be used to evaluate the expression.
</p>
<p>
  Go have a look at these classes... Start getting familiar
  with their constructor, their methods, especially the
  constructors that are used by the parser to build the
  abstract syntax tree. You will see that types are used
  quite intensively, to type expressions and to verify
  assignments.
</p>
<p>
  So let's start with typing expressions. It all starts
  with typing values, with the primitive types.
  Then, since variables are typed, symbols are typed as well.
  This means that we can type expressions if we can type the resulting
  values from applying operators. For example, if we know the
  types of the variable "x" and "y", we can type the
  following expression
</p>
<pre class="prettyprint lang-java">
  > x + y ;
</pre>
<p>
  Of course, we have to consider all the operators of the language:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>'+' for the addition</li>
  <li>'-' for the substraction</li>
  <li>'*' for the multiplication</li>
  <li>'/' for the division</li>
  <li>'&&' for the logical and</li>
  <li>'||' for the logical or</li>
  <li>'!' for the logical not/li>
</ol>
<p>
  For the last three, the arguments are boolean values and the
  resulting value is a boolean. We also have comparison operators
  that can be typed as producing boolean values:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>'==' for equality</li>
  <li>'!=' for equality</li>
  <li>'&lt;' for equality</li>
  <li>'&lt;=' for equality</li>
  <li>'&gt;' for equality</li>
  <li>'&gt;=' for equality</li>
</ol>
<p>
  But what about the first operators, the arithmetic operators:
  '+', '-', '*', and '/'. What is the type of the resulting value
  when evaluated? Well, it depends on the types of the values the
  operator works on. Right?
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    A '+' between 
    <span class="java-keyword">int</span> values will produce an
    <span class="java-keyword">int</span> value.
  </li>
  <li>
    A '+' between
    <span class="java-keyword">float</span> values will produce a
    <span class="java-keyword">float</span> value.
  </li>
  <li>
    What about a '+' between an
    <span class="java-keyword">int</span> value and
    <span class="java-keyword">float</span> value?
  </li>    
</ul>
<p>
  And this is where it gets interesting because it requires
  a decision to be made.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Should the operation happen on
    <span class="java-keyword">int</span> values?
  </li>
  <li>
    Should the operation happen on
    <span class="java-keyword">float</span> values?
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  Choosing <span class="java-keyword">int</span> values
  would require to convert the float value to a int value,
  which is not right since we would loose information.
  Choosing <span class="java-keyword">float</span> values
  seems better since converting an int value to a float value
  is quite alright.
</p>
<p>
  At first, this seems to indicate that we will several
  versions of each arithmetic operator, one per type.
  Fortunately, we can do better than that.
  Look at the class
  <span class="java-class">AddOp</span> and more precisely
  at the method
  <span class="java-method">eval</span>:
</p>
<pre class="prettyprint lang-java">
  @Override
  protected Value eval(Value left, Value right) {
    ArithValue l = (ArithValue)left;
    ArithValue r = (ArithValue)right;
    return l.add(r);
  }
</pre>
<p>
  See how the operator delegates to the values.
  This is polymorphic code at the rescue since
  it works with all
  arithmetic values. So if we have float values,
  the method <span class="java-method">ArithValue.add</span>
  will compute the addition of two float values.
  If we have integer values,
  the method <span class="java-method">ArithValue.add</span>
  will compute the addition of two integer values.
</p>
<p>
  Go look at the code and understand how the overriding
  of methods is used to achieve just that. Look how
  abstract methods on the class
  <span class="java-class">ArithValue</span>
  are overridden by the subclasses
  <span class="java-class">IntValue</span>
  and
  <span class="java-class">FloatValue</span>.
  For instance:
</p>
<pre class="prettyprint lang-java">
public class IntValue extends ArithValue {
  @Override
  public ArithValue add(ArithValue right) {
    return new IntValue(m_value+right.toInt());
  }
}
</pre>
<p>
  But wait a second, how are we sure that
  both values are of the same type? In the code
  above, what happens
  if the right value is not an integer? Let's
  suppose that we have a float value.
  The float value will be converted to an integer
  value by the method
  <span class="java-method">FloatValue.toInt</span>.
  Sounds fine, right?
</p>
<p>
  Well, not really, if you understood what we said
  earlier. Indeed, we just said that the evaluation of
  a '+' between an integer value and a float value
  would work just fine. But we said earlier that
  this may induce of a loss of information. Something
  that should be avoided. And this is where types
  are used during parsing, when building the AST,
  to prevent such expressions to be built.
  So if you type the following expression:
</p>
<pre class="prettyprint lang-java">
  > float f = 2.3;
  > int x = 2 + f;
</pre>
<p>
  The parser could build an expression with
  the '+ operator and a left expression being
  the value '2' and the right expression being
  the symbol "f" corresponding to a float variable.
  This would be an erroneous
  expression, as we just explained, since the
  left and right expressions do not have the same
  type. The left is an
  <span class="java-keyword">int</span>
  while the right is a 
  <span class="java-keyword">float</span>.
</p>
<p>
  So we want the parser to complain and tell
  you that there is a missing cast operation.
  Indeed, if you really want to write the above
  assignment, you really need to write it with
  an explicit cast:
</p>
<pre class="prettyprint lang-java">
  > float f = 2.3;
  > int x = 2 + (int)f;
</pre>
<p>
  The explicit cast operation expresses that you
  know what you are doing and that you want to round
  the value of the variable "f" to an integer value.
</p>
<p>
  See types are used all the time, both by you and the
  interpreter. You use types to express what you
  want. The interpreter uses types to interpret what you typed.
  So the type system is central to the dialog between you
  and the interpreter.
  When you develop in Java, a different
  type system is there, but it plays the same role and help
  Eclipse show you the red crosses when you type Java code
  that is not quite correct.
</p>

<h3>Parsing versus Interpreting</h3>

<p>
  We cannot insist enough between what happens during parsing and
  what happens during interpreting. It is crucial that you keep
  these two "executions" in your mind at all time. There is first
  a phase where a statement typed on the keyboard is parsed into
  an abstract syntax tree. And then there is the second phase
  when the abstract syntax tree is interpreted.
</p>
<p>
  In the previous task, we look at what happens when interpreting,
  regarding types and the potential casting of values.
  In this task, we are concerned with what happens during parsing,
  also regarding types. This is all about validating the
  abstract syntax tree, before it is interpreted.
  So what do we want to validate?
</p>
<ul>
  <li> Validate expressions. </li>
  <li> Validate assignments. </li>
</ul>
<p>
  For that, let's turn our attention to the class
  <span class="java-class">TypeSystem</span> and
  the following methods:
</p>
<pre class="prettyprint lang-java">
public class TypeSystem {
  public static Type lift(Type left, Type right);
  public static void assignable(Type t1, Type t2) throws CastException;
}
</pre>
<p>
  The first one is used to type-check expressions,
  the second is used to type-check assignments.
  You can use Eclipse to help you understand how these
  two methods are invoked. Remember that you can select
  in Eclipse any element of the Java language and hit
  <b>Ctrl-Shift-G</b> to search for all the locations
  where that language element is used.
  This is one of the best features of Eclipse, it helps you
  navigate code quickly, especially code that you did not write.
  So let's do this together.
</p>  

<h3>Validating Expressions</h3>

<p>
  So go ahead and select the method
  <span class="java-method">lift</span> and hit
  <b>Ctrl-Shift-G</b>. Where did it find this method
  invoked? Only from the constructor of the class
  <span class="java-class">BinaryOp</span>. Not really
  surprising afterall, right?
</p>
<p>
  First, the constructor is invoked at parsing time,
  since the elements of an abstrac syntax tree are
  constructed when constructing the tree, which happens
  when the builder is invoked by the parser.
  So this is consistent with what we said earlier,
  we are concerned with what happens when parsing.
</p>
<p>
  Second, only binary operators are concerned with wondering
  how two types can be used to together, as we discussed earlier.
  The concern here is really two fold. On the one hand, the
  concern is about the ability to use the two types together.
  In other words, can the two types be used together by
  any operator? On the other hand, the concern is about the
  resulting type of the operator.
</p>
<p>
  Remember, operators are polymorphic operators, so they really
  do not know what values they operate on. This means they do not
  know what types these values have. So operators cannot make
  any decisions regarding the above concerns. Each value or
  their type cannot make any decision either, it is a decision
  across two types, requiring the knowledge of those two types.
  This is why the method
  <span class="java-method">lift</span> is available
  on the class
  <span class="java-class">TypeSystem</span>, an impartial
  intermediary if you will.
</p>
<p>
  The table below gives you the rules:
</p>
<table style="border: 1px solid black">
  <tr>
    <th>&nearr;</th>
    <th>int</th>
    <th>float</th>
    <th>boolean</th>
    <th>char</th>
    <th>void</th>
    <th>any</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>int</th>
    <th>int</th>
    <th>float</th>
    <th></th>
    <th></th>
    <th></th>
    <th>int</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>float</th>
    <th>float</th>
    <th>float</th>
    <th></th>
    <th></th>
    <th></th>
    <th>float</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>boolean</th>
    <th></th>
    <th></th>
    <th>boolean</th>
    <th></th>
    <th></th>
    <th>boolean</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>char</th>
    <th></th>
    <th></th>
    <th></th>
    <th>char</th>
    <th></th>
    <th>char</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>void</th>
    <th></th>
    <th></th>
    <th></th>
    <th></th>
    <th></th>
    <th></th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>any</th>
    <th>int</th>
    <th>float</th>
    <th>boolean</th>
    <th>char</th>
    <th></th>
    <th>any</th>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>
  So go ahead, 
  implement the method
  <span class="java-method">lift</span> 
  on the class
  <span class="java-class">TypeSystem</span>.
  Notice that all types have a number, in our
  implementation of the class
  <span class="java-class">Type</span>.
</p>
<pre class="prettyprint lang-java">
public abstract class Type {

  private int m_tno;
  private String m_name;

  protected Type(String name) {
    m_tno = -1;
    m_name = name;
    TypeSystem.add(this);
  }

  protected Type(String name, int tno) {
    m_tno = tno;
    m_name = name;
    TypeSystem.add(this);
  }
</pre>
<p>
  The primitive types have the first
  numbers, see the method
  <span class="java-method">init</span> 
  on the class
  <span class="java-class">TypeSystem</span>.
</p>
<pre class="prettyprint lang-java">
public class TypeSystem {
  public static void init() {
    
    types = new HashTable();
    
    new IntType(0);
    new FloatType(1);
    new BooleanType(2);
    new CharType(3);
    new VoidType(4);
    new AnyType(5);

    ArrayType.init();
  }
}
</pre>
<p>
  But also notice that other types do not have
  a number (in fact they have the number -1).
  So what are these types? How can you know?
  Well, again, you have a specific constructor,
  so look where it is invoked from... using
  Eclipse and the <b>Ctrl-Shift-G</b> feature.
  So? Well, it is invoked from the constructor
  of arrays. So these types are array types,
  such as
  <span class="java-keyword">int[]</span>,
  <span class="java-keyword">char[]</span>,
  <span class="java-keyword">float[]</span>, and so on.
</p>
