<p>
  This task is to get you started with the large code base we provided
  you with. We know, you do not like that much being given an existing
  code base; you often prefer starting from scratch. Nothing wrong
  with that, but being able to grasp and modify an existing code base
  is an important skill to have.
</p>
<p>
  First, from a teaching perspective, giving you a code base allows to
  cover more intersting projects. At your level, starting from scratch
  a Java interperter would be rather difficult and would require much more
  time than we have. So why attempt such a project? Because it offers you
  the opportunity to not only learn a programming language to develop with,
  but also implement a language to get a finer understanding of the concepts
  of programming languages. There is nothing better than trying to implement
  a concept to understand its finer points.
</p>
<p>
  Second, in your future jobs and internships, very few of you will have
  to start from scratch. Most of the time, you join a team of developers
  with an existing code base. That code base is rarely small, it is usually
  large or even huge. It can range from a few thousands of lines to
  millions of lines of code. So learning how to navigate a large code
  base is important. Furthermore, learning how modularity and encapsulation
  helps with such complexity is also important.
</p>

<h3>Modularity and Encapsulation</h3>

<p>
  Rely on the modularity and encapsulation of the code to better navigate
  and learn the given code base. So far, many of you are probably looking
  at object-oriented programming techniques as hard and as a lot of concepts
  that may not seem like very useful. Well, here is the opportunity to see
  object-oriented programming in action for the better.
</p>
<p>
  The code base is several thousands of lines of code, with dozens of classes,
  so it is a large code base by your standards. Do not be intimidated, you will
  be able to ease yourself in, incrementally, thanks to the object-oriented
  design of the code. Let us give you a few tips.
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    Look at the source folders.
  </li>
  <li>
    Look at the Java package structure.
  </li>
  <li>
    Grow an idea of the class hierarchy.
  </li>
  <li>
    Use the debugger to grasp the overall execution flow
  </li>
</ol>
<p>
  <b>Look at the source folders:</b>
  it is often a coarse-grain modularity
  that helps a first understanding of the large features at play.
</p>
<ul>
  <li><em>src</em> folder: the implementation.</li>
  <li><em>tests</em> folder: available tests.</li>
</ul>
<p>
  <b>Look at the Java package structure:</b>
  it provides a finer-grain modularity
  that helps a first understanding of the main features at play.
</p>
<ul>
  <li><em>ricm3.ovm</em>: the core package</li>
  <li><em>ricm3.ovm.ast</em>: the abstract syntax tree</li>
  <li><em>ricm3.ovm.builder</em>: the builder for the AST</li>
  <li><em>ricm3.ovm.parser</em>: the parser</li>
</ul>
<p>
  In the core package, you will find the entry point to launch
  the execution, look at the class
  <span class="java-class">OvmMain</span>.
  You will find exception classes.
  You will find in that
  package classes that you know already the purpose of:
  <span class="java-class">Variable</span>,
  <span class="java-class">Context</span>, and
  <span class="java-class">Interpreter</span>.
  The classes 
  <span class="java-class">Type</span> and
  <span class="java-class">TypeSystem</span> are new
  to you, but you can guess what they are about: types
  in the language such as 
  <span class="java-keyword">int</span> or
  <span class="java-keyword">float</span>.
</p>
<p>
  For the abstract syntax tree, you can see it is itself
  composed of different packages:
</p>
<ul>
  <li><em>ricm3.ovm.ast.arith</em>: about arithmetic expressions</li>
  <li><em>ricm3.ovm.ast.array</em>: about arrays</li>
  <li><em>ricm3.ovm.ast.bool</em>: about boolean expressions and comparators</li>
  <li><em>ricm3.ovm.ast.flow</em>: about the execution flow</li>
</ul>

<p>
  <b>Grow an idea of the class hierarchy:</b> this one is very imporant.
  Use the <b>F4</b> key in Eclipse with a class or an interface selected
  in the Eclipse editor. Eclipse will show you the class hierarchy.
  Write it down on paper, study and understanding it. The sooner you
  will get familiar with the class hierarchy, the sooner you will be
  efficient and feel empowered to do the changes we will be asking you
  to do.
</p>

<h3>Arithmethic Support</h3>

<p>
  The arithmetic support is implemented, so we asked that you launch
  the interpreter and try arithmetic expressions under the control
  of the debugger. Remember not to single step through the parser,
  this is ugly generated code, so set breakpoints where you have an
  interest in and then single step from there.
</p>
<p>
  Since you have implemented a calculator before, start with the
  arithmetic expressions, focusing on learning what is different
  in this implementation. You will find the same concepts that you
  know about: operators, values, variables, and a context.
  Try out expressions like this:
</p>
<pre class="prettyprint lang-java">
  int x;
  int y = 2;
  x = 1;
  y = y + 2 * x;
  float z = 2.3;
  z = z + y;
</pre>
<p>
  Learn how the AST is built and how it is evaluated.
  Look at the class
  <span class="java-class">ArithValue</span> and its subclasses
  <span class="java-class">IntValue</span> and
  <span class="java-class">FloatValue</span>.
  This will give you the knowledge you need to implement
  the boolean support.
</p>  

<h3>Boolean Support</h3>

<p>
  Speaking of changes, the first one is to finish the support for
  boolean expressions and comparators. The coding has been started
  already and the features have been integrated in the code base,
  but the implementation is essentially a skeleton, methods
  mostly throw a NotImplementedException.
</p>

<h4>Boolean Value</h4>

<p>
  This is the perfect place to start. A boolean value is obviously
  a value, so go look at the super class
  <span class="java-class">Value</span>.
  You will be not be suprised to see that it is abstract
  and it is an expression. What can you do with a value?
  You can evaluate it to itself. Again, you should not be
  surprised there. And you can compare values: equals
  (<span class="java-method">eq</span>) or not equals 
  (<span class="java-method">ne</span>).
</p>
<p>
  Back to the class 
  <span class="java-class">BooleanValue</span>,
  you find the methods overriding the abstract
  methods 
  <span class="java-method">eq</span> and
  <span class="java-method">ne</span>.
  And you find new methods that are
  the operations that are specific for boolean values:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>Method <span class="java-method">not</span> when parsing "!x" for example</li>
  <li>Method <span class="java-method">and</span> when parsing "x && y" for example</li>
  <li>Method <span class="java-method">or</span> when parsing "x || y" for example</li>
</ol>
<p>
  These methods are really easy to implement.
</p>

<h4>Boolean Type</h4>

<p>
  We will cover types fully in the next task, so we will keep it simple here.
  You know what is a type, you use it every day when coding. You use types
  to <em>"type"</em> your variables, such as "int" or "char". So here,
  the class 
  <span class="java-class">BooleanType</span>
  represents the type 
  <span class="java-keyword">boolean</span> in our language.
</p>
<p>
  This is a singleton class, that is, a class with a single instance.
  So look at the constructor in details, see how we use a static variable
  to hold that unique instance of the class
  <span class="java-class">BooleanType</span>.
  Look also how the constructor ensures that the class
  <span class="java-class">BooleanType</span> is instantiated
  only once.
</p>
<p>
  Notice also the static variable
  <span class="java-svar">zero</span> that also holds
  a singleton, the object that represents the value zero.
</p>
<pre class="prettyprint lang-java">
  private static BooleanValue zero = new BooleanValue(false);
  @Override
  public Value zero() {
    return zero;
  }
</pre>
<p>
  Remember that Java initializes all your variables with
  the value zero corresponding to their type. Well, we will
  do the same and rather than instantiating zero values all
  the time, we will use a single object to represent all
  zero values.
</p>
<p>
  <b>Does it work you wonder?</b> Can we use a single object
  to represent all the zero values?
  What if someone changes that value
  object? Then zero would no longer be the value zero. That would
  be really confusing, would it not?
</p>
<p>
  Very good question, but fortunately, the design is correct.
  Changing the object that represents the value zero is not possible,
  so we are good. Look at the class 
  <span class="java-class">BooleanValue</span> for example
  and see that it is read-only. See, the field
  <span class="java-field">m_value</span> is private
  and there are not setter methods. Therefore, once a value object
  has been constructed with a given value, its value can never
  be changed. Relieved? Of course, this all works fine.
</p>
<p>
  Look briefly at the super class
  <span class="java-class">Type</span> to read the description
  of the methods
  <span class="java-method">cast</span> and
  <span class="java-method">checkcast</span>.
  Now look at the given implementation,
  it is obviously wrong:
</p>
<pre class="prettyprint lang-java">
  @Override
  public Value cast(Value v) {
    return v;
  }
  @Override
  public boolean checkcast(Type t) {
    return true;
  }
</pre>
<p>
  Can you figure out why the above methods are wrong?
  We hope you do because you know that in Java you cannot
  cast a boolean to anything else than a boolean.
  For instance, you cannot write this:
</p>
<pre class="prettyprint lang-java">
  int x = (int)true;
</pre>
<p>
  But the code we just wrote considers that all values
  are boolean values, which is wrong. It also considers
  that all types can be casted to a boolean type, which is
  also entirely wrong.
  You can check this launching the execution of our
  interpreter and typing this:
</p>
<pre class="prettyprint lang-java">
  > int x = 2;
  > boolean z;
  > z = x;
  > z;
  -> 2
</pre>
<p>
  This is all wrong, the boolean variable 'z' know
  holds an integer value '2'. 
  So let's fix this:
</p>
<pre class="prettyprint lang-java">
  @Override
  public Value cast(Value v) {
    if (this!=v.type())
      throw new CastException(this, v);
    return v;
  }
  @Override
  public boolean checkcast(Type t) {
    return (t == this);
  }
</pre>
<p>
  This is more like it, right?
  Well, let's try it.
</p>
<pre class="prettyprint lang-java">
  > int x = 2;
  > boolean z = x;
  OK: boolean z = x;

  ricm3.ovm.CastException: Invalid: (boolean)(int)
 	at ricm3.ovm.ast.bool.BooleanType.cast(BooleanType.java:41)
	at ricm3.ovm.Variable.write(Variable.java:64)
	at ricm3.ovm.ast.VarDecl.eval(VarDecl.java:62)
	at ricm3.ovm.Interpreter.loop(Interpreter.java:29)
	at ricm3.ovm.Interpreter.interactive(Interpreter.java:68)
	at ricm3.ovm.OvmMain.main(OvmMain.java:35)  
</pre>
<p>
  The parser says the text is OK, which is fine, the syntax
  is correct. But the interpreter now understands the
  semantics is wrong, it understands that an integer value
  cannot be casted to a boolean value. 
</p>
<p>
  If you are lost,
  ask questions, you <b>must understand this</b>.
  Understanding types is important for this sprint,
  but more importantly, it is important to be a decent
  developers, since you use types everyday when writing code.
  Also, it will get more complex about types
  in the next task, so do not get lost already.
</p>

<h4>Boolean Operators</h4>

<p>
  This is going to be a walk in the park for you, since
  you already coded a calculator with similar operators.
</p>
<ol>
  <li>Operator "!": method <span class="java-method">not</span></li>
  <li>Operator "&&": method <span class="java-method">and</span></li>
  <li>Operator "||": method <span class="java-method">or</span></li>
</ol>
<p>
  Notice that you have methods on the class
  <span class="java-class">BooleanValue</span> for all those
  operators, so use them when implementing the method
  <span class="java-method">eval</span> on the
  operator classes 
  <span class="java-class">AndOp</span>,
  <span class="java-class">OrOp</span>, and
  <span class="java-class">NotOp</span>.
</p>
<p>
  Now that you have implemented operators, try using them
  from the interpretor. For example, you could type:
</p>
<pre class="prettyprint lang-java">
  > boolean z = true;
  > z && false;
  -> false
  >
</pre>
<p>
  Take charge of your learning, test all operators.
</p>

<h4>Boolean Comparison</h4>

<p>
  This is also going to be a walk in the park for you, since
  we adopted an implementation that is likely to be quite
  intuitive for you. In contrast to boolean operators, we
  do not use yet another class hierarchy. This time,
  we went for the switch-based implementation, just to show
  you that both designs are possible.
  So look at the class 
  <span class="java-class">CompOp</span>, you can see
  the enum for all the possible operators:
</p>
<ol>
  <li> EQ for "==", the equality of values</li>
  <li> NE for "!=", the inequality of values</li>
  <li> GT for "&gt;", greater than </li>
  <li> GE for "&gt;=", greater or equal</li>
  <li> LT for "&lt;", less than</li>
  <li> LE for "&lt;=", less or equal</li>
</ol>

<p>
  Now that you have implemented comparisons, try using them
  from the interpretor. For example:
</p>
<pre class="prettyprint lang-java">
  > int x = 2;
  > int y = 3;
  > (x == y);
  -> false
  >
</pre>
<p>
  Take charge of your learning, test all operators.
