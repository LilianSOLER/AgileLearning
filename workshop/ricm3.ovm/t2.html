<p>
  Our programming language will be inspired by Java, but much simplified.
  We provide here the description of what you can write with this
  language. The semantics will be the same as in Java.
  We will also draw your attention on the syntactical limitations of
  our language compared to Java.
</p>
<p>
  We draw your attention on the importance of reading and understanding
  the following paragraphs. It is a good opportunity for you to check
  that you understood the core concepts of programming and that you have
  mastering the right vocabulary to discuss or describe these concepts.
  Do not settle for an approximative understanding, you will pay the price
  later when trying to implement the interpreter. No one can code something
  they do not understand fully.
</p>
<p>
  Note: every year, some students fail implementing the interpreter fully,
  complaining it is too hard and that what was expected was not clear. For
  a few, they have done their homework and they are really experiencing some
  difficulties, but they can be helped with these difficulties quite easily.
  But for too many, the problem
  originates with the too common attitude of "let's read through all this
  quickly, we already know that stuff, and there are just too many details...
  and too many new words to remember...". We will see later.
  Well, invariably, they see, they fail, and then they complain.
  So please, take charge of your learning.

<h3>The elements of the language</h3>

<h4>Primitive Types</h4>

<p>
  The language supports several primitive types:
  <span class="java-keyword">int</span>,
  <span class="java-keyword">float</span>,
  <span class="java-keyword">char</span>,
  and <span class="java-keyword">boolean</span>.
</p>

<h4>Variables</h4>

<p>
  The language supports the concept of variables, typed with primitive types.
</p>
<pre class="prettyprint lang-java">
  int v1;
  float v2;
  char v3;
  boolean v4;
</pre>

<h4>Arrays</h4>

<p>
  The language supports the concept of arrays of primitive types.
</p>
<pre class="prettyprint lang-java">
  int[] intArray = new int[3];
  char[] charArray = new char[2];
  float[] floatArray = new float[10];
  boolean[] boolArray = new boolean[5];
</pre>
<p>
  Remember to use the syntax used above, you
  <b>cannot use</b> the following syntax:
</p>
<pre class="prettyprint lang-java">
  int intArray[];
</pre>
<p>
  Note: the language supports the polymorphic type 
  <span class="java-keyword">any</span> that represents
  any of the above primitive types. This allows to define
  polymorphic functions such as:
</p>
<pre class="prettyprint lang-java">
  int length(any[] array);  // returns the length of an array.
</pre>
<p>
  The language also supports the concept of arrays of
  arrays:
</p>
<pre class="prettyprint lang-java">
  int[][] array = new int[3][4];
</pre>

<h4>Native functions</h4>

<p>
  Certain functions cannot be written in the language, they
  are called native functions. The list is the following:
</p>
<pre class="prettyprint lang-java">
  void length(any[]);
  void printc(char);
  void printi(int);
  void printf(float);
  void printb(boolean);
  float random();    // valeur entre [0.0, 1.0[
  char read();       // lie l’entrée standard
  void env() ;       // print les variables globales
  void load(char[]); // charge un fichier de code
</pre>
<p>
  Note: if you find that you are missing some native functions,
  you can send an email to the teaching staff so that we may improve
  that list of native functions through the years.
  <xfr>
    Note : Si vous en trouvez d’autres qui vous marque,
    envoyez un email au groupe, incluant les
    professeurs, pour que l’on puisse améliorer cette liste.
    Merci d’avance.
  </xfr>
</p>

<h4>User-defined functions</h4>

<p>
  The language allows you to define functions.
  Since you can define functions, you may also invoke
  already defined functions.
  A few examples are the following:
</p>
<pre class="prettyprint lang-java">
  int fact(int n) {
    if (n==1) {
      return n ;
    }
    return n * fact(n-1) ;
  }
  void foo() {}
  void bar() {
    return;
  }
  float min(float x, float y) {
    float min = x;
    if (y &lt; x) {
      min = y;
    }
    return min;
  }
</pre>
<p>
  Notice the concept of a lexical block, delimited by "{ ... }".
</p>

<h4>Lexical Blocks</h4>

<p>
  Lexical blocks are really important for three reasons.
</p>
<p>
  First, a lexical block represents a sequence of statements
  that will be executed in sequence. Of course, some statements
  are controlling that execution flow, see below for
  <em>control flow statements</em>.
</p>
<p>
  Second, any block may define local variables. 
  Local variables only exist within the block they are defined in.
  Therefore, each block manages a context of local variables.
</p>
</p>
  Variables defined outside of any lexical block are global variables.
  Global variables live forever in the global context of the
  interpreter.
</p>
<p>
  Third, lexical blocks participate in looking up variables.
  Indeed, lexical blocks naturally nest during execution,
  either because of function invocations or because of
  control flow statements. For example:
</p>
<pre class="prettyprint lang-java">
  int fact(int n) {
    if (n==1) {
      return n ;
    }
    return n * fact(n-1) ;
  }
  int x = fact(3);
</pre>
<p>
  The invocation of the <em>fact</em> function will end up
  during the execution by nesting up to 4 lexical blocks.
</p>
<pre class="prettyprint lang-java">
fact(3);
->  fact(3) {
    |  return n * fact(n-1);
    |  -> fact(2) {
    |     |  return n * fact(n-1) {
    |     |  -> fact(1) {
    |     |     |  if (n==1) {
    |     |     |  |  return n;
    |     |     |  }
    |     |     }
    |     }
    }
</pre>
<p>
  Therefore, the nesting of lexical blocks form a stack
  of contexts that must be used to lookup variables by name.
  This means that when looking up a variable by name,
  let's "n", the current block at the top of the stack
  must be used to lookup the variable. If not a variable
  by that name is not found, the next block on the stack
  must be tried, and so on, until the global context
  is tried.
</p>
<p>
  Notice that function calls will also require a lookup
  by name, but the lookup is much simpler since we only
  allow functions to be defined in the global context.
  This means that looking up a function by name is only
  tried in the global context.
</p>
   
<h4>Control flow statements</h4>

<p>
  The language supports three statements that control the execution flow:
  <xfr>
    Les structures de contrôle du flot d’exécution sont les suivantes:
  </xfr>
</p>
<ol>
  <li>if-then-else</li>
  <li>while</li>
  <li>return</li>
</ol>
<p>
  Find below a few examples:
</p>
<pre class="prettyprint lang-java">
  if (i &gt; 10) {
    i = 10 ;
  } else {
    if (i &lt; 0) {
      i = 0;
    }
  }
  while (i &gt; 0) {
    i = i - 1 ;
  } 
</pre>
<p>
  Notice that all blocks must be defined by "{...}".
  You <b>cannot write</b> the following:
  <xfr>
    Il faut savoir que tout bloc commence et se termine avec des accolades.
    Vous ne pouvez pas écrire ce qui suit:
  </xfr>
</p>
<pre class="prettyprint lang-java">
  if (i &gt; 10) 
    i = 10 ;
  else {
    if (i &lt; 0) 
      i = 0;
  }
</pre>
<p>
  Also notice that we do not support "else if" construct.
  You <b>cannot write</b> the following:
  <xfr>
    If faut aussi se rappeler que le langage n'inclu pas la construction
    "else if".
    Vous ne pouvez pas écrire ce qui suit:
  </xfr>
</p>
<pre class="prettyprint lang-java">
  if (i &gt; 10) {
    i = 10 ;
  } else if (i &lt; 0) {
    i = 0;
  }
</pre>
	     
<h3>Interpreter Session</h3>

<p>
  An interpreter session begins when you launch the interpreter
  and ends when you quit the interpreter. During a session,
  the interpreter manages a global context, holding the global
  variables that have been defined. For example:
</p>
<pre class="prettyprint lang-java">
  > int x = 3;
  > int y = 2 * x;
  > printi(x);
  3
  > printi(y);
  6
  >
</pre>
<p>
  Then, you can define functions at the global level, like you just
  did with global variables.
</p>
<pre class="prettyprint lang-java">
 >  int fact(int n) {
      if (n==1) {
        return n ;
      } 
      return n * fact(n-1) ;
    }
 > int z = fact(5);
 > printi(z);
 120
 >
</pre>
<p>
  You can look in the <em>"samples"</em> directory where you
  will find samples of pretty much all the features of our
  language.
</p>

<h3>Caveats</h3>

<p>
  Please be understanding, writing a parser is a difficult task.
  We did our best, but the parser we provided you will
  have bugs and error messages will not be that user-friendly.
  So please accept our apologies in advance. To improve your experience,
  respect the syntax used in the examples above. Especially respect the
  <b>do-not</b> points discussed above.
</p>
<p>
  Before complaining, remember that we gave you a working parser, we
  could have asked that you implemented one. Do you really think
  yours will be less buggy? Maybe, but probably not. So accept
  our apologies for the inconvenience and move on, find ways around
  the parser bugs. Furthermore, bugs are unavoidable, so you see,
  you are not the only ones introducing bugs in released code.
  And you know what... bugs are what keep us employed...<br>
