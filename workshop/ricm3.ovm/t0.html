  So let's illustrate what is an interpreter, so that you get an idea of
  what we are building here. So let's compare an interpreter to a compiler.
</p>
<p>
  So let's talk about Java. First, you edit some sources, your files with
  a <em>java</em> extension. Then, you use the Java compiler to compile
  those sources into classfiles, files with the <em>class</em> extension.
  Finally, you launch the execution of the Java Platform that loads your
  classes, using a classpath where to find the classfiles.
</p>
<p>
  With interpreted language, things are different. It all starts with
  launching an interpreter and starting an interative session. This
  is very much like Linux shell, which is in fact an interpreter.
  So you type lines of commands and they are interpreted right away
  as you hit enter. Hence the name: an interpreter. So let's illustrate
  a simple session:
</p>
<textarea class="terminal">
  $ cd ~/AgileLearning/workshops/oop/ricm3.ovm
  $ java -cp bin ricm3.ovm.OvmMain
  >
</textarea>
<p>
  See, from the shell interpreter, you launched the execution of the
  Java platform that loaded our interpreter, resulting in our interpreter
  prompting you for entering a statement of the language. See that the
  prompt as changed from '$' to '>'.
</p>
<p>
  What is a statement?
  The simplest form is an arithmetic expression ended by a semicolumn:
</p>
<pre class="prettyprint lang-java">
  > 2 + 3 ;
  -> 5
  >
</pre>
<p>
  When you hit enter, the statement was parsed and then interpreted. The
  statement was recognized by the parsing as an expression that is correct
  syntactically. Then, it was interpreted and the value '5' was computed.
  Our language will support variables:
</p>
<pre class="prettyprint lang-java">
  > int x = 2;
  > int y = 3;
  > x + y ;
  -> 5
  >
</pre>
<p>
  We just define two global variables named "x" and "y".
  We can also define functions:
</p>
<pre class="prettyprint lang-java">
  > int x = 2;
  > int y = 3;
  > x + y ;
  -> 5
  > void min(int x, int y) {
  if (x &lt; y)
    return x;
  return y;
  }
  >
</pre>
<p>
  Now, the interpreter knows a function named "min". You
  can therefore invoke it:
</p>
<pre class="prettyprint lang-java">
  > min(2,3);
  -> 2
</pre>
<p>
  So you get the idea of a session, this is an interactive session
  between you and the interpreter. You write down statements, one
  at a time, and they are interpreted as you type them. So now,
  let's move on more technical details about the internals of
  the interpreter and then discuss the specifics of our language.
