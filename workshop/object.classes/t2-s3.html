<vars>
  sprint=object.classes
  task=t2
  step=t2-s3
</vars>

<p>
  In this step, we will continue to leverage polymorphic programming,
  to further enhance our design and coding patterns. The goal is always
  to help reduce redundant coding and to help with code evolution.
</p>

<h3>Abstracting the implementation</h3>

<p>
  So far, we have a good design with one good implementation.
  But how could we have different implementations?
  Of course, we could start all over again, from the original
  interfaces. But this would require a lot of recoding.
  Polymorphic programming offers an alternative.
</p>
<p>
  So go look into the source folder <em>"task3"</em>
  and in the
  package <span class="java-package">oop.filesys.task3</span>.  
  It is pretty much a copy of the previous step, but with
  abstract classes for directories and files. The goal of these
  abstract classes is to gather the most code that will be
  common to most implementations. Some methods will be
  abstract and overriden by subclasses.
</p>
<p>
  So let's start with those common methods, reusing
  as much code as possible from step2. This is what
  we mean by not wanting to restart our coding from scratch.
  We will be able to reuse a lot of code.
  So let's carry over the implementation
  from the previous step.
</p>

<h4>The Class Directory</h4>

<p>
  Let's start with the class
  <span class="java-class">Directory</span> in the
  package <span class="java-package">ricm3.filesys.oop</span>
  where you
  will methods that throw an NotYetImplemented
  exception.
  These are the methods that are common to all implementations,
  for which you can carry code from the previous step.
  So go ahead, for each of those methods, just copy and
  paste the code you wrote and tested in the previous step.
</p>
<p>
  When cutting and pasting your code, you will see that some
  parts will no longer compile since the collection of nodes
  is now a generic collection
  (<span class="java-class">ICollection</span>).
  What should you do then?
</p>
<p>
  Well, <b>DO NOT</b> change the type of the collection of nodes, leave it
  to <span class="java-class">ICollection</span>. We know, it is
  your first thought, but it is the wrong one here. Remember,
  we want to keep the code generic, so that different subclasses
  may use different implementations of the collection of nodes.
  So we want the abstract concept of a directory to use an
  abstract concept of a collection.
  So, how should we fix the compilation errors then?
</p>
<p>
  Well, look at the abstract methods of the 
  class <span class="java-class">Directory</span>:
</p>
<pre class="prettyprint lang-java">
  /**
   * Adds the given node as a child of this directory.
   * MUST call Node.added(Directory)
   */
  abstract protected void add(Node node) throws IOException;
  
  /**
   * Removes the given node from the children of this directory.
   * MUST call Node.removed()
   */
  abstract protected void remove(Node node) throws IOException;

  /**
   * Gives an iterator on the nodes in this directory
   * @return
   */
  abstract protected Iterator iterator();
</pre>
<p>
  What are they? They are the contract asked from subclasses
  in order to be able write the common methods at the level
  of the abstract class <span class="java-class">Directory</span>.
  So fix your code using these methods.
  Depending on how you wrote your code, this may mean little
  changes or more substantial changes. If you have substantial
  changes, you probably didn't write such clean code in the
  first place. So take this opportunity to improve your
  coding style.
</p>
<p>
  Still missing something? Most probably. You are probably
  wondering how you will create directories and files, since
  the classes are abstract now. This is a perfectly valid point.
  At the level of the class <span class="java-class">Directory</span>,
  in the methods <span class="java-method">mkdir</span>,
  and <span class="java-class">touch</span>, you do not know
  how to create a directory or file since you do not know
  which implementation is used. Even worse, we do not even
  have an implementation yet. So what should you do?
</p>
<p>
  Well, look at the class <span class="java-class">FileSystem</span>
  and the new concept of a factory. Look at the methods
  <span class="java-method">newFile</span> and
  <span class="java-method">newDirectory</span>.
  They provide what you need, a way to create a new file or a
  new directory. So use these methods from your class
  class <span class="java-class">Directory</span>,
  in the methods <span class="java-method">mkdir</span>,
  and <span class="java-class">touch</span>.
</p>
<p>
  This coding pattern is called <b>delegation</b>. This is like real life
  delegation. For instance, if one of your pipes leak, you may not know
  how to repair it, but you may delegate the repair task to a plumber. This is the
  same idea. A directory object does not know which implementation is used,
  so it delegates to its file system. The file system does not know
  either, but it is given an object, a factory object that knows how to create
  files and directories. Pretty darn cool, right?
</p>
<p>
  There is indeed a cool pattern here. We write polymorphic methods at
  the level of the abstract class
  <span class="java-class">Directory</span>.
  But the code reqires that the subclasses provide some methods,
  through overridden abstract methods. These methods will be
  specific to each implementation. We have a win-win
  situation here. We have a lot of common polymorphic methods on
  the abstract class <span class="java-class">Directory</span>, methods that
  are fairly complex, for only a few and very simple methods on all
  subclasses.
</p>

<h4>The Class File</h4>

<p>
  Now let's turn our attention to the
  class <span class="java-class">File</span>, also
  an abstract class. Well, as one might have expected, the class
  is entirely abstract, meaning that all methods are dependent on the
  implementation of a file. Hence, there are 
  no common methods that can be provided at the level of
  the abstract concept of a file. Oh well, sometimes, polymorphic
  programming helps with sharing common methods, some other times,
  it is not the case.
</p>

<h3>Concrete Implementations</h3>

<p>
  Now it is time to turn our attention to the actual implementations.
  We will do two implementations, trying to reuse again a lot of code,
  whenever possible. The main difference will be choosing a different
  implementation for the collection of nodes in a directory.
  One implementation will use a linked list
  while the other will use a hash table. The two implementations
  will be in the Java package
  <span class="java-class">ricm3.filesys.oop.ramfs</span>.
</p>

<h4>Linked-list Implementation</h4>

<p>
  Let's turn our attention to our first implementation.
  Of course, we will reuse the one we already did in the
  previous step. So turn your attention to the
  package <span class="java-package">ricm3.filesys.oop.ramfs</span>.
  It is named after the idea that we are implementing a file
  system in memory, since we are only using Java objects
  and we are not using any real storage device such as a USB
  key or a disk drive.
</p>
<p>
  Let's start with the classes
  <span class="java-class">RamDirectory</span>
  and
  <span class="java-class">RamFile</span>.
  As you can see in the constructor, the suggested implementation
  for the class <span class="java-class">RamDirectory</span>
  is by using a linked list, from our available collections.
  This is the implemenation choice we did before, in step2. 
  For the class
  <span class="java-class">RamFile</span>, we 
  also reuse the previous implementation from step2,
  using an array of bytes.
</p>
<p>
  So go ahead, complete the implementation of these two classes
  <span class="java-class">RamDirectory</span>
  and
  <span class="java-class">RamFile</span>.
  Once you are done, you have a new complete implementation.
  Just have a look at the factory, the
  class <span class="java-class">ricm3.filesys.oop.ramfs.Factory</span>.
  See how it can be used to create either implementation of our
  file system: using a map (using hash table)
  or not (using a linked list).
</p>
<p>
  Cool. So go ahead, do some testing of your new implementation.
  You can have a look in the Java package 
  <span class="java-package">ricm3.filesys.oop.ramfs</span>,
  for either the 
  class <span class="java-class">ShellMain</span>
  or the 
  class <span class="java-class">TestStep3</span>,
  as example of how to setup a file system and then starting to
  use it.
</p>
<p>
  So go ahead, take charge of your learning, experiment with
  our tests and our shell.
</p>

<h4>Map-based Implementation</h4>

<p>
  When your linked-list implementation works, it is time
  to start looking at our alternate implementation using a
  map (hash table). Look at the class 
  <span class="java-class">RamMapDirectory</span>,
  still in the Java package
  <span class="java-package">ricm3.filesys.oop.ramfs</span>.
  So go ahead, complete the implementation
  using a <span class="java-class">HashTable</span>
  instead of a <span class="java-class">LinkedList</span>.
</p>
<p>
  Notice that there are several inherited methods that may be
  optimized, when using a hash table instead of a linked list.
  This very point is one of the great features of object-oriented programming.
  You may use inherited methods, available on super-classes,
  saving coding time. Or you may override some of these
  inherited implementations if you know how to improve them.
  The best of both worlds. You may avoid recoding a lot at first
  and then recode only the few methods for which a better performance
  really matters.
</p>
<p>
  So which inherited methods can we improve here? The super-class
  <span class="java-class">Directory</span> uses an iterator
  to iterate over the collection in order to search for a given
  name. Since we have a hash table and we have used the name
  of nodes as the key, we have available a much faster lookup
  based on names. So go ahead, optimize these methods, leveraging
  the methods <span class="java-method">get</span> and
  <span class="java-method">put</span> on the
  class <span class="java-class">HashTable</span>.
  You may use the shell to debug your code,
  but remember to use a factory that creates the map-based
  implementation, not the linked-list one.
</p>

<h4>Passing our tests</h4>

<p>
  Ultimately, you need to pass our tests on both the
  linked-list and the map-based implementations.
  Look at the class
  <span class="java-class">TestStep3</span>
  in the Java package
  <span class="java-class">ricm3.filesys.oop.ramfs</span>.
  Before you can pass those tests, you have to implement
  both the class 
  <span class="java-class">RamDirectory</span>
  and
  <span class="java-class">RamMapDirectory</span>.

<h3>Wrapping the Linux File System</h3>

<p>
  To further illustrate the power of object-oriented programming,
  we will do another implementation: safe wrapping of the Linux file system.
  The idea is simple. Linux has a file system, composed of directories
  and files. Since we modeled our file system interfaces on the linux
  file system, it seems possible to wrap the Linux file system with
  our file system.
</p>
<p>
  We will do a safe read-only wrapping. This means that we will be able
  to see the directory tree and read files, but will not be able to
  damage the underlying file system. This is really important, we do
  not want a bug in your code to damage the machine you use to work
  everyday, do we? Of course not.
  Therefore, the wrapping will done as follows.
</p>
<p>
  For directories, we will start from a root directory, in the
  Linux file system. This Linux directory will be wrapped as the root
  of our file system. For every Linux subdirectory, we will create a
  directory object, instance of the class
  <span class="java-class">WrapDirectory</span>. So we will create
  a hiearchy of directory objects that is identical to the hierarchy of
  directories in your Linux file system, starting at the chosen
  root directory. But of course, any removal of a directory will
  only have effect in the Java world, not in the Linux file system.
</p>
<p>
  Then for the files in those directories,
  we will wrap them as well, creating for each Linux file
  a corresponding file object, instance of
  the class <span class="java-class">WrapFile</span>.
  For safety, we will load files but we will never write any
  modification back. Of course, any removal of a file will only
  take effect in the Java world, not in the Linux file system.
</p>
<p>
  We have a delicate point to discuss: saving memory. Indeed, we
  do not want to load all the files from your Linux file system
  into memory, as Java files and byte arrays. To improve performance
  and save memory, we do not want to load
  any Linux file contents in memory, unless we have to.
  So we will implement lazy loading.
</p>
<p>
  Lazy loading means that when creating a file wrapper object
  (<span class="java-class">WrapFile</span>), we do not load the
  contents of the wrapped file. But if the file wrapper object is
  used to read bytes or write bytes, we will load the Linux file contents
  only at that time in a byte array. All reads and writes will then
  be performed on this byte array. 
</p>
<p>
  <b>IMPORTANT</b>: remember, you must not alter the underlying file
  system in anyway, for safety reasons. Otherwise, a bug in your code
  might damage your file system and you may no longer be able to use
  your machine. Therefore, you must
  <b>never</b> write back any data from a wrapper file to the underlying
  Linux file. Also, you must <b>never</b> progagate any change from a
  wrapper directory to the underlying directory. This means that you
  do not rename, remove, or create files in the Linux file
  system. This also means that you
  do not rename, remove, or make new directories in the Linux file
  system.
</p>

<h4>Class <span class="java-class">WrapDirectory</span></h4>

<p>
  Let's discuss the class <span class="java-class">WrapDirectory</span>
  in more details. Look at the constructors, see how they load
  the contents of the corresponding Linux directory, creating
  Java objects to represent each directory and each file.
  Notice the recursion through the constructor,
  since constructing a wrapper directory loads its contents, which
  constructs more wrapper directories that load their contents, 
  and so on.
</p>
<p>
  And this is pretty much it. Once a wrapper directory has loaded
  the contents of its corresponding Linux directory, it behaves as
  a ramfs directory, that is, as its super-class, the class
  <span class="java-class">RamDirectory</span>.
</p>

<h4>Class <span class="java-class">WrapFile</span></h4>

<p>
  Let's discuss the class <span class="java-class">WrapFile</span>
  in more details. It is interesting because it is quite different
  from the details on the class
  <span class="java-class">WrapDirectory</span>.
  First of all, most of the methods of the class
  <span class="java-class">WrapFile</span>
  are not implemented, so you need to precisely understand what
  we are trying to achieve here.
</p>
<p>
  As we just saw with the class
  <span class="java-class">WrapDirectory</span>, a wrapper file
  is created for a corresponding Linux file. This can be easily
  confirmed by looking at the constructor.
  But the interesting difference is that the constructor does not
  load the contents of the Linux file.
  So the first question is why?
</p>
<p>
  Can you answer it? Well? Lazy loading? Yes, that was the purpose
  of the above discussion about lazy loading and saving memory.
  This is where it applies. When wrapping a linux file, the constructor
  does not load the file contents into a byte array. We are
  smart, we will wait to load the file contents until
  we are sure we need it. So let's
  consider the different methods on a file:
</p>
<pre class="prettyprint lang-java">
  public int size();
  public int available();
  public byte read() throws IOException, EOFException;
  public void write(byte val) throws IOException;
  public void seek(int offset) throws IOException;
</pre>
<p>
  For the first two, we do not need to load the contents, since
  a Linux file (java.io.File) knows its length. Beware though that
  once you loaded the file, into a byte array, that byte array is
  telling you the size and the available number of bytes. Indeed,
  once the file is loaded, the byte array might be modified and
  may no longer correspond to the original file. So, until the
  file is loaded, the file tells you the size and the available
  number of bytes, but not once you loaded the file contents in
  memory.
</p>
<p>
  For the other methods of a file, the contents of the file must be
  first loaded. Look at the method
  <span class="java-method">load</span> that loads the Linux file
  contents into a byte array, if it was not already loaded.
  Look at the code, you will see how to read from a Linux file in Java,
  using a random acces file. Notice that the byte array referenced
  from the inherited fields from the super-class
  <span class="java-class">RamFile</span>.
</P>
<p>
  Notice the use of a <span class="java-keyword">try-finally</span>
  statement in order to make sure that the random access file is always
  closed, no matter what happens. A <span class="java-keyword">try-finally</span>
  statement always executes the <span class="java-keyword">finally</span> block,
  that the execution flow returns or throws an exception.
  So in this case, even if the <span class="java-keyword">try</span> block
  throws an IOException because of an error during the reading of the contents
  of the file, the the <span class="java-keyword">finally</span> block will
  be executed.
</p>
<P>
  Once the bytes are loaded, the wrapper file should behave exactly as
  a regular ramfs file (the class <span class="java-class">RamFile</span>).
  Remember that you can use the keyword <span class="java-keyword">super</span>
  to invoke the super-class implementation of overriden methods.
