  This task is to illustrate further the power of object-oriented programming
  when it comes to evolving an existing code.
  We will introduce
  the concept of symbolic links. If you do not remember what they are in
  a Linux file system, please read about them on the Web.
  The Linux shell command is <em>"ln -s path1 path2"</em>.
</p>
<p>
  So symbolic links are like URLs, a link is essentially a
  path, relative or absolute, leading to a node. It could be
  about have another name in the same directory:
</p>
<textarea style="terminal">
  $ touch toto
  $ ln toto titi
  $ ls
  toto titi
  $
</textarea>
<p>
  Symbolic links work for file but also for directories:
</p>
<textarea style="terminal">
  $ cd /
  $ mkdir toto
  $ ln toto titi
  $ ls
  toto/ titi/
  $ cd titi
  $ pwd
  /toto
</textarea>
<p>
  Notice how the change of the current directory worked.
  The link is just a redirection in some sense, we changed
  to "titi" but we ended up in "/toto" because "titi" is
  really a link to "/toto".
</p>
<p>
  But more interestingly, it is usually about aliasing across
  the file system. Like this:
</p>
<textarea style="terminal">
  $ cd /
  $ mkdir toto/tata
  $ ls toto
  tata
  $ mkdir tutu
  $ cd tutu
  $ ln /toto/tata titi
  $ pwd
  tutu
  $ ls
  titi
  $ cd titi
  $ pwd
  /toto/tata
  $
</textarea>

<h3>Introducing Symbolic links</h3>

<p>
  Let's introduce symbolic links, but without implementing them.
  This is one powerful aspect of object-oriented programming,
  you can introduce concepts and evolve your existing code even
  before you actually have an implementation for the new feature.
  So look in the source folder <em>task6</em> and in the Java
  package
  <span class="java-package">ricm3.filesys.oop</span>.
</p>
<p>
  You can see just the interface
  <span class="java-class">Link</span>, with only one
  method
  <span class="java-method">follow()</span>.
  This is what a link is, it something that you can follow
  to a node.
</p>
<p>
  Introducing links will impact your implementation of the
  class
  <span class="java-class">Directory</span>, since you
  have to handle properly the case where a node implements
  the interface <span class="java-class">Link</span>.

  There are two places where it matters, when a directory
  searches for a file or a directory by name. In both
  cases now, it is possible that the node implements
  the interface <span class="java-class">Link</span>
  and the method
  <span class="java-method">follow()</span> must
  be invoked to get at the linked node.
</p>


<h3>Discussing Designs</h3>

<p>
  In fact, we could have considered extending the class
  <span class="java-class">Node</span>, instead of introducing an
  interface? After all,
  we could consider that a node is either a file, a directory,
  or a link. So we could add the method
  <span class="java-method">follow()</span> to our existing
  class
  <span class="java-class">Node</span>.
  It is certainly a possible design, with the default
  implementation being something like this:
</p>
<pre class="prettyprint lang-java">
package ricm3.filesys.oop;
public class Node {
  ...
  public Node follow() { 
    return this;
  }
}
</pre>
<p>
  This would have been acceptable design as well.
</p>



<h3>Implementing Symbolic links</h3>

<p>
  After you reflected on how you would do it, it will be much more
  interesting for you to compare your approach with ours.
  Look at the
  class <span class="java-class">SymLink</span>
  and its two subclasses
  class <span class="java-class">FileLink</span>
  and
  class <span class="java-class">DirLink</span>.
  Also look at the 
  class <span class="java-class">FileSystem</span> and
  its methods <span class="java-method">link</span>,
  they show you how links are created.
  Finally, you can try symbolic links from our shell,
  using the command <em>ln</em>.
</p>
<p>
  We used polymorphic programming to our advantage. We introduced
  a new concept: a link. But a link takes two forms, one
  as a link to a file and the other as a link to a directory.
  So we have three classes. The class
  class <span class="java-class">SymLink</span>
  represents the abstract concept of a link.
  The class
  class <span class="java-class">FileLink</span> represents
  the link to a file and the class
  class <span class="java-class">DirLink</span> represents
  a link to a directory.
</p>
<p>
  Notice how little was necessary to add the concept of links,
  in fact, we were able to do it without touching the implementation  
  of our classes
  <span class="java-class">Directory</span>
  and
  <span class="java-class">File</span>.
  This was possible because we used polymorphic programming
  for the class 
  class <span class="java-class">Directory</span>.
  Indeed, a directory contains a list of nodes, whatever a node is. Originally,
  a node was only a file or a directory. Now, it can also be a link.
</p>
<p>
  This is the power of polymorphic programming. You write code to handle
  one class of objects, but in fact, it will work with any sub-class,
  without modifications.

    That's all folks for this step.
    But before we move on, please make sure
    that you commit and push your work to our server:
  </p>
  <textarea class="terminal" rows="5" width="60%" >
  $ git add --all
  $ git commit -m "Sprint object.classes, Task6 completed"
  $ git push --all
  </textarea>
